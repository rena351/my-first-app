The "Reputation Management" Flow: The business owner starts their day by opening the Reviews tab. They see a new 2-star review. They click Reply and use a template to write a polite, professional response to address the customer's issue. They then see a new 5-star review and quickly reply with a "Thank you!"
The "Holiday Hours" Flow: A holiday is approaching. The owner goes to the Business Information page, clicks to edit their hours, and sets special hours for the holiday. They click Publish Updates. Aura Publish automatically updates their hours on Google, Yelp, and all other connected directories, saving them hours of manual work.
