3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Tool View)
The core of the app is a simple, workflow-based interface for each tool.
Typical Workflow:
Upload Screen: A large, friendly drag-and-drop area that says "Drop your PDF here" or a "Select File" button.
Tool Interface: After the file is uploaded, the specific tool's interface appears.
Download Screen: After the action is complete, a confirmation screen appears with a large "Download Your New PDF" button and a preview of the file.
Example: The "Merge PDFs" Interface:
After uploading multiple files, they appear as large thumbnails.
The user can drag and drop the thumbnails to get them in the correct order.
A large Merge PDFs button is on the right.
Example: The "Edit PDF" Interface:
The uploaded PDF is shown in a viewer.
A toolbar appears at the top with simple tools: Add Text, Add Image, Draw, Highlight. The user clicks a tool and then clicks on the PDF to apply the change.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Data entry is minimal and highly contextual to the tool being used (e.g., typing text in the "Add Text" tool, setting a password in the "Password Protect" modal).
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Combine Reports" Flow: A user has three separate weekly reports saved as PDFs. They need to combine them into a single monthly report. They go to Aura PDF Editor, choose the Merge PDFs tool, and upload the three files. They drag them into the correct weekly order and click "Merge." They can then download the single, combined monthly report PDF.
The "Fix a Typo" Flow: A user receives a final PDF contract from a client but notices a small typo. Instead of asking the client to resend it, they use the Edit PDF tool. They upload the PDF, click the Add Text tool, draw a white box over the typo to hide it, and then use the text tool again to type the correct word on top. They download the corrected version.
The "Secure Document" Flow: An HR manager needs to send a sensitive employee document. They use the Password Protect tool. They upload the PDF, and a modal asks them to set and confirm a password. They download the new, encrypted PDF. They then send the PDF in one email and the password in a separate, secure message (like an Aura Cliq chat).
The "File Size" Flow (Integration): A user is trying to attach a large PDF to an email in Aura Mail, but it's over the 25MB attachment limit. Aura Mail automatically shows a pop-up: "This file is too large. Would you like to compress it with Aura PDF Editor?" The user clicks "Yes." The file is sent to the Compress PDF tool, a smaller version is created, and it is automatically attached to the email.
