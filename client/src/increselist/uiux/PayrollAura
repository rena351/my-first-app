3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The "Run Payroll" Wizard)
The most critical interface is the Run Payroll Wizard, a secure, step-by-step process.
Step 1: Timesheets & Hours:
Imports approved hours from Aura People (Time & Attendance module).
Allows for manual entry of special hours like overtime or vacation pay.
Step 2: Review Payroll:
A detailed table showing each employee, their gross pay, deductions, taxes, and final net pay.
The user must carefully review this screen. Totals are displayed at the bottom.
Step 3: Submit Payroll:
A final confirmation screen. The user clicks a large, green "Submit Payroll" button. They may be asked to enter a 2FA code for security.
The Employee View (Employee Self-Service Portal):
A separate, secure portal that employees can log into.
Pages: Paystubs (view and download all past paystubs), Tax Forms, My Profile (update bank account or address).
4. Data Entry & Modals
Adding an Employee (Full Page Wizard): A secure, multi-step form to collect sensitive information: legal name, address, tax filing information, and bank account details for direct deposit.
Previewing a Paystub (Modal): In the "Review Payroll" step, clicking on an employee's name opens a modal pop-up showing a preview of what their exact paystub will look like.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Bi-weekly Payroll" Flow: Two days before payday, the payroll admin gets a reminder. They log into Aura Payroll and click Run Payroll. The system automatically pulls in all the approved hours from Aura People. The admin reviews the summary, checks for any anomalies, and clicks Submit. On payday, the system automatically processes the direct deposits to all employees and debits the company bank account.
The "New Hire" Flow: A manager hires a new employee in Aura Recruit. This automatically triggers the Onboarding workflow in Aura Payroll. The new employee receives a secure link to a self-service portal where they can fill out all their personal and tax information themselves, reducing administrative work and errors.
The "Tax Filing" Flow (Automated): After each payroll run, Aura Payroll automatically calculates the company's federal and state tax liabilities. At the end of the quarter, the system automatically files the necessary tax forms and makes the tax payments electronically. The admin simply receives a notification that the filing is complete.
