Pages:
Dashboard: The main overview. Shows "Emails Sent Today," a graph of "Delivery vs. Bounces" over the last week, and the current "Sender Reputation" score.
Section: Sending
Icon: Send
Pages:
Mail Agents: The core concept. A "Mail Agent" is a container for a specific type of transactional email (e.g., "AURA Welcome Emails," "AURA Invoice Receipts," "AURA Password Resets"). This is the main list of all your transactional email streams.
Domains: A critical page to verify the domains you are sending email from. This is where you get the SPF and DKIM records to add to your DNS, which proves to other email servers that you are not a spammer.
Section: Analytics
Icon: BarChart3
Pages:
Processed Logs: A real-time, searchable log of every single email that has been processed by the system.
Bounces: A filtered list showing only the emails that have failed to deliver, with the reason for the bounce.
Rejects & Spam: A list of emails that were rejected or marked as spam.
Section: Development
Icon: Code
Pages:
API & SMTP: The most important page for a developer. It contains the API Keys and SMTP Credentials needed to send emails from another application's code.
Webhooks: A page to set up webhooks, which are automated notifications sent to your server when an email event happens (e.g., "notify my app when an email is opened").
Templates: A library of email templates that can be triggered via the API.
3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface

6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Welcome Email" Flow (Developer's Task): A developer is building the signup feature for the AURA suite. They go to Aura ZeptoMail, create a new Mail Agent called "AURA Onboarding Emails." They go to the API & SMTP page and copy the API key. In their backend code for the signup process, they add a few lines of code that use this API key to send an email through the "AURA Onboarding Emails" agent to the new user's email address.
The "Password Reset" Flow (Automated): A user on the AURA login page clicks "Forgot Password." The AURA backend code receives this request. It generates a secure, one-time reset link. It then makes an API call to the "AURA Password Resets" Mail Agent in Aura ZeptoMail, telling it to send an email containing this link to the user. The email is delivered in under 2 seconds.
The "Troubleshooting" Flow: A user complains that they are not receiving invoice receipts. The support agent goes to Aura ZeptoMail, opens the Processed Logs, and searches for the user's email address. They find the log entry for the invoice email. It says Bounced with the reason "Mailbox full." The agent can now tell the user the exact reason their email is not being delivered.
