6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Hire" Flow (Automation): An HR manager creates a new employee in Aura People. This automatically triggers a workflow in Aura Directory. A new user account is created. The user is added to the "New Hires" group. This group membership automatically grants them access to a pre-defined set of applications: Aura Mail, Aura Cliq, and Aura Connect. The new hire receives one welcome email with one password. When they log into their "My Apps" dashboard for the first time, all the tools they need are already there.
The "Single Sign-On" Flow: A user wants to access Aura CRM. They go to the CRM login page. The page redirects them to the Aura Directory login page. They enter their single username and password. The system then instantly and securely logs them into Aura CRM without them having to remember a separate password.
The "Offboarding" Flow (Security): An employee leaves the company. The HR manager marks them as "Terminated" in Aura People. This automatically triggers a workflow in Aura Directory. The user's account is instantly deactivated. This one single action immediately revokes their access to all connected applications (Aura apps, Salesforce, Office 365, etc.), securing the company's data in seconds.
