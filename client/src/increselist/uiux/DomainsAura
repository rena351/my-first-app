Buttons to + Add New Record.
A list of existing records (A, CNAME, MX, TXT) with options to Edit or Delete each one.
Often includes pre-set templates to easily connect the domain to other AURA apps (e.g., a "Connect to Aura Sites" button that automatically adds the correct records).

Below, it provides a long list of alternative suggestions with different endings (.net, .io, .co) and creative variations.
Adding a DNS Record (Modal): Clicking + Add New Record opens a simple pop-up form with dropdowns to select the record Type (A, CNAME, etc.) and text boxes for the Host (e.g., "www") and Value (e.g., an IP address).

6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Website" Flow: A user has just built a site in Aura Sites. They come to Aura Domains, search for my-new-business.com, and see that it is available. They buy it. Then, they go to the DNS Records tab for their new domain, click a pre-set button that says "Point to Aura Sites," and the system automatically configures all the records. An hour later, their new website is live at their custom domain.
The "Professional Email" Flow: A user wants a professional email address. In the DNS Records tab for their domain, they click another pre-set button, "Configure for Aura Mail." The system automatically adds the correct MX records. They can now go to the Aura Mail app and create an account for rohan@my-new-business.com.
The "Domain Transfer" Flow: A user is tired of their old domain registrar. They start the "Transfer a Domain" wizard in Aura Domains. The wizard gives them a checklist: 1. Unlock the domain at your current registrar. 2. Get the "Authorization Code." 3. Enter the code here. After they enter the code, the transfer process begins, which can take several days to complete.
