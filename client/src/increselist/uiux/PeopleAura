6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Leave Request" Flow: An employee wants to take a vacation. They go to their Leave Tracker, see they have 10 days of vacation available, and submit a request for next month. Their manager receives a notification in Aura Mail and Aura Cliq. The manager clicks a link, sees the team's shared Leave Calendar to ensure there are no conflicts, and clicks "Approve." The employee is notified, and their leave balance is automatically updated.
The "Performance Review" Flow: At the start of a quarter, the HR admin initiates a new Appraisal Cycle. Every employee and manager in the company receives a task to complete their self-assessment and review, respectively. The system automatically sends reminders as the deadline approaches.
The "New Hire" Flow (Integration): A candidate accepts an offer in Aura Recruit. This automatically triggers the Onboarding workflow in Aura People. An AURA account is created for them, they are automatically enrolled in training in Aura Learn, and their details are sent to Aura Payroll to be included in the next pay run. This seamless automation saves the HR team hours of manual work for every new hire.
