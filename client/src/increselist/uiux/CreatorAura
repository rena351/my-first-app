3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Builders)
The application consists of several powerful visual builders.
The Form Builder:
A drag-and-drop interface.
Left Panel: A library of field types (Text, Number, Date, Image Upload, Lookup to link to other forms).
Center Panel: A canvas where you build the form.
The Page Builder:
A drag-and-drop interface for creating custom dashboards.
Left Panel: A library of widgets (Chart, Panel, Button, Embed Form, Embed Report).
Center Panel: A canvas where you arrange the widgets to build your UI.
The Workflow Builder:
A code editor for writing business logic using a simplified, powerful scripting language (like Zoho's Deluge).
It has a drag-and-drop builder for simple "if-then" logic and a full code editor for advanced tasks.
4. Data Entry & Modals
The data entry happens in the live version of the custom application you build.
The "Lookup" Field: This is a key feature. When building a form, you can add a "Lookup" field that links to another form. In the live app, this field becomes a searchable dropdown that lets you connect records (e.g., linking an "Invoice" record to a "Customer" record).
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Simple App" Flow: An HR manager needs a simple app to track company-owned laptops. They go to Aura Creator and Create a New Application. They use the Form Builder to create a "Laptops" form with fields for "Serial Number," "Model," and a Lookup field to connect to an "Employees" form. They then create a Report to show a list of all laptops. In 15 minutes, they have built a custom asset tracking app.
The "Automation" Flow: In their new asset tracking app, the HR manager wants an email to be sent to the IT department when a laptop's "Status" is changed to "Needs Repair." They go to the Workflows section and create a new rule. The Trigger is "On User Edit" of a laptop record. They add a Condition: IF "Status" is changed to "Needs Repair". The Action is "Send Email" to it-support@aura.com. The automation is now live.
The "Professional App" Flow (Integration): A developer is building a complex logistics application. They use Aura Creator to build the entire frontend and business logic. They use the Connections feature to make secure API calls to Aura Maps for route optimization and to Aura Sign for signing delivery confirmations. They are using Aura Creator as a powerful "backend-as-a-service" to build a complex system much faster than with traditional coding.
