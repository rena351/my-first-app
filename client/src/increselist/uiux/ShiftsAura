3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Scheduler)
The core of the app for managers is the Scheduler.
Main View: A large grid.
Rows: A list of all employees.
Columns: The days of the week.
Toolbar at the top:
View Switcher: By Employee (default) or By Position (e.g., see all "Cashier" shifts).
Copy & Paste: A button to copy the previous week's schedule to use as a starting point.
Publish Schedule: The most important button. When clicked, it sends a notification to all employees that the new schedule is live.
Labor Cost Bar (at the bottom): A dynamic bar that updates in real-time as the manager adds shifts, showing the projected labor cost for the week and comparing it against the budget.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Creating a Shift (Modal): A manager clicks on an empty cell in the scheduler grid. A pop-up appears where they can set the Start Time, End Time, Position (e.g., "Server"), and any Notes.
Requesting a Shift Swap (in the Employee mobile app): An employee taps on one of their upcoming shifts. They tap "Offer Shift." A screen appears where they can send a request to a specific colleague or offer it to all eligible colleagues.
5. Bottom Bar
The dynamic Labor Cost Bar in the Scheduler view.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Schedule Creation" Flow: A manager starts the week by clicking Copy Last Week's Schedule. The grid populates with the old schedule. They make a few drag-and-drop adjustments for time-off requests. They see the Labor Cost Bar is slightly over budget, so they shorten one shift by an hour. Once the budget looks good, they click Publish Schedule.
The "Employee" Flow: Every employee receives a push notification on their phone: "The schedule for next week has been published!" They open the Aura Shifts mobile app and can see all their assigned shifts.
The "Shift Swap" Flow: Rohan sees he is scheduled for a shift he can't work. He opens the app, taps the shift, and selects "Offer Shift to Team." Priya gets a notification: "Rohan is offering his Tuesday shift." Priya needs extra hours, so she taps "Accept." The manager gets a final notification: "Priya has accepted Rohan's shift. Approve?" The manager clicks Approve, and the schedule is automatically updated for everyone.
The "Time Clock & Payroll" Flow (Integration): Employees use a tablet in the break room (or their phones with geofencing) to Clock-in and Clock-out via Aura Shifts. At the end of the pay period, the manager goes to Timesheets, reviews all the hours, and clicks "Approve All." This approved timesheet data is then automatically sent to Aura Payroll to be processed for payment.
