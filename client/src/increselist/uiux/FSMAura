6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Service Call" Flow: A customer calls with a broken machine. A support agent in Aura Desk creates a Work Order in Aura FSM. The dispatcher sees the new, unscheduled work order on their Scheduling & Dispatch dashboard. They see that "Technician A" is nearby and has the right skills. They drag the work order onto Technician A's schedule for 2:00 PM.
The "Technician's Day" Flow: Technician A gets a notification on their mobile app about the new job. They finish their current job and tap "Start Travel" for the next one. The app gives them directions. They arrive and tap "Check-in." They diagnose the problem, use the app to see which parts they need from their truck's inventory, and complete the repair. They take a photo of the finished work, have the customer sign on their screen, and tap "Complete Job."
The "Automated Invoicing" Flow: As soon as the technician taps "Complete Job," the system automatically takes the parts used, the time logged, and the service fee, and generates a professional invoice in Aura Books. The invoice is then automatically emailed to the customer. This turns a process that used to take days into something that happens instantly.
