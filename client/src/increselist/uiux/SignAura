Inside the "Send for Signatures" Workflow (a multi-step wizard):
Step 1: Upload: A large drag-and-drop area to upload a PDF or Word document.
Step 2: Recipients: A section to add signers by name and email, and an option to "Set Signing Order."
Step 3: Prepare Document: The document is displayed in an editor. A right-side panel has draggable fields like Signature, Initials, Date Signed, Text Box, Checkbox. The user drags these fields onto the document for each signer.
Step 4: Review & Send: A final screen to customize the email subject and message before sending.
4. Data Entry & Modals
The Signing Experience (What the recipient sees):
The recipient gets an email with a "Review & Sign" button.
This opens a simple, guided view of the document.
Arrows guide the user to each required field.
When they click a signature field, a modal pops up allowing them to Draw their signature, Type it, or Upload an image of it.
A "Finish" button at the end completes the process and sends a copy to all parties.
5. Bottom Bar
Generally minimal. It might contain links to "Legal Information" or "Terms of Service."
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The Sender Workflow: The user's primary job is the "Send for Signatures" wizard. They upload a document, add people, place fields, and send. Their secondary job is to monitor the Dashboard to see which documents are still "In Progress" and may require a follow-up.
The Signer Workflow: The user's primary job is to check their Waiting for My Signature list, open documents, and follow the guided process to apply their signature to the required fields.
The Template Workflow: For repetitive documents, a power user will go to Templates, upload a standard contract, place all the fields, and save it. Now, instead of starting from scratch, they can just click "Use Template," which skips directly to the "Add Recipients" step, saving a huge amount of time.
