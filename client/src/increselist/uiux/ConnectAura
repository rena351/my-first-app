6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Company Announcement" Flow: The CEO wants to make an important announcement. An HR manager goes to Aura Connect, writes a post in the special, company-wide "Announcements" feed. Every employee receives a notification. Employees can "Like" the post to acknowledge they have seen it and ask questions in the comments, creating a two-way dialogue.
The "Project Collaboration" Flow: A new project begins. The project manager creates a new, private Group called "#Project-Phoenix." They invite all the team members. Inside this group, they share files, post updates, and use the integrated Tasks module to manage their work. All project communication is now centralized in one place, instead of being scattered across emails and chat messages.
The "Knowledge Sharing" Flow: A senior developer discovers a new, better way to write a piece of code. They go to the Manuals (Wiki) section and write a short article explaining the new technique. They share a link to this article in the "#Developers" group. Now, all other developers in the company can learn from this new best practice, and the knowledge is saved permanently for future new hires.
