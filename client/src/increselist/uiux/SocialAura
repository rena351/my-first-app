3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Post Composer)
The most important interface is the New Post Composer, which is often a large modal pop-up.
Components of the Composer:
Channel Selector: Checkboxes at the top to select which social networks this post will go to.
Text Area: A large box to write the main text of the post. It shows a character count for networks like Twitter.
Media Uploader: Buttons to upload images or videos.
Link Shortener: Automatically shortens any links you paste.
Live Previews: On the right side, it shows a live, accurate preview of how the post will look on each selected social network (e.g., how it will look on Facebook vs. how it will look on LinkedIn).
Publishing Options (at the bottom): Buttons for Publish Now, Schedule for Later (opens a calendar), or Add to Queue.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Adding a Stream in "Monitor" (Modal): A pop-up asks the user what they want to track (e.g., "Mentions of my brand," "Posts with the hashtag #AuraLaunch") and for which network. This then creates a new column in their Monitor dashboard.
Responding to a Mention (Action): In the Monitor view, each incoming mention has buttons directly on it to Reply, Like, or Retweet. Clicking "Reply" opens a small text box to type a response.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent, to maximize screen space for content feeds and calendars.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Content Scheduling" Flow: A social media manager plans their content for the week. They open the New Post composer, write a post, upload an image, and select to post it to Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. They click Schedule for Later and choose Wednesday at 10:00 AM. The post then appears on their Calendar view.
The "Community Management" Flow: The user spends their day in the Monitor tab. They have a column that tracks all mentions of "Aura." When a new tweet appears from a customer asking a question, they click the Reply button directly from within Aura Social and answer the question. This reply is then posted publicly on Twitter.
The "Reporting" Flow: At the end of the month, the manager goes to the Reports page. They run a report on "Post Engagement" to see which of their posts got the most likes and comments. They discover that posts with videos perform best, and they use this information to plan next month's content.
