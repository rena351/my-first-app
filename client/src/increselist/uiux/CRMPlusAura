6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Morning Huddle" Flow: A sales manager starts their day by opening the Aura CRM Plus Dashboard. They can see in a single glance how many new leads came in overnight, how many new support tickets were created, and how the latest email campaign is performing. They don't need to open three different apps.
The "Pre-Call Prep" Flow: A salesperson has a call with a major client. Before the call, they go to the Customers section of Aura CRM Plus and open the client's "360° View." They instantly see that the client has an open, high-priority support ticket in Aura Desk. The salesperson now knows not to start the call with a sales pitch, but instead to ask, "I see you're having an issue with... How can I help?" This turns a potential conflict into a relationship-building moment.
The "Marketing to Support" Flow (Data-Driven): The Head of Marketing is looking at the Reports in Aura CRM Plus. They run a report that combines data from Aura Campaigns and Aura Desk. They discover that customers who receive the "Advanced Tips" email series submit 50% fewer support tickets. They now have proof that their marketing content is successfully educating customers and reducing the load on the support team.
