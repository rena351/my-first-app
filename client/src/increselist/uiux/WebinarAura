6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Webinar Creation & Promotion" Flow: A user clicks Schedule Webinar. They fill out the details. The system automatically creates a public Registration Page. The user copies the link to this page and promotes it using Aura Campaigns and Aura Social.
The "Attendee" Flow: A person clicks the registration link, fills out a simple form, and clicks "Register." They automatically receive a confirmation email with a unique link to join the webinar and a calendar invite. They later receive a reminder email one hour before the event starts.
The "Live Event" Flow: 10 minutes before the start time, the host and presenters join a private "Green Room" from the webinar's page. They test their cameras and microphones. At the start time, the host clicks Start Broadcast. They share their screen to show a presentation. During the presentation, they launch a Poll to engage the audience. At the end, they look at the Q&A tab and answer the most popular questions. When finished, they click End Broadcast.
The "Post-Webinar" Flow: After the event, the recording automatically appears in the Recordings library. The system automatically sends a follow-up email to everyone who attended, with a link to the recording. The host goes to the Reports page to analyze who attended and how long they stayed, using this data to identify hot leads for the sales team in Aura CRM.
