3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Three-Panel View)
The main interface is a powerful, three-panel view, similar to a modern email or helpdesk client.
Left Panel (The Conversation List):
A list of email conversations based on the view selected in the sidebar (e.g., Unassigned). Each item shows the sender, subject, and the agent it's assigned to.
Center Panel (The Conversation Thread):
Displays the full history of the selected email conversation.
At the bottom: A rich text editor for writing a reply.
Tabs at the top of the editor: Reply (to the customer), and Comment (to write a private, internal note for your team).
Right Panel (Context & Properties):
A panel showing all the important details about the conversation.
Assignee: A dropdown to assign the conversation to a specific team member.
Tags: A field to add tags for categorization (e.g., "Urgent," "Billing-Issue").
Snooze: A button to temporarily hide the conversation.
Customer Info: A powerful section that automatically pulls in data from Aura CRM, showing the customer's details and their recent sales deals or support tickets.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Writing an Internal Comment: The primary "collaboration" action. An agent can @mention a colleague in a private comment to ask a question without the customer seeing it.
Creating a Rule (in Settings): A wizard-like interface to create automation rules. For example: IF an email subject contains the word "Urgent," THEN automatically ASSIGN it to the "Senior Support" team and ADD the "Urgent" tag.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Triage" Flow: A new email arrives in the Support Inbox. It appears in the Unassigned view. A team lead looks at it, sees it's a technical question, and in the Right Panel, Assigns it to Rohan, a technical expert.
The "Collaboration" Flow: Rohan receives a notification that a conversation has been assigned to him. He opens it in his Assigned to Me view. He reads the question but is not sure of the answer. In the Center Panel, he clicks the Comment tab and types, "@manager, I need your approval for this refund." The manager gets a notification, opens the same conversation, and types a reply in the comments: "@Rohan, approved. Please proceed." Rohan can now confidently reply to the customer.
The "Collision Detection" Flow: Two agents, Rohan and Priya, both open the same unassigned ticket at the same time. At the top of the conversation, a small yellow warning appears: "Priya is also viewing this conversation," with her profile picture. This prevents them from accidentally sending two different replies to the same customer.
