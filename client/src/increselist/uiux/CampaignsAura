3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Campaign Builder)
The core of this application is the Campaign Builder, a multi-step wizard.
Step 1: Setup:
Fields for "Campaign Name," "Subject Line," "Sender Name," and "Sender Email."
Step 2: Design:
Options to choose a Template, import HTML, or use a Drag-and-Drop Editor.
The editor is a visual canvas where you can drag in content blocks (Text, Image, Button, Spacer).
Step 3: Audience:
Checkboxes to select which Lists or Segments will receive the campaign.
Step 4: Send:
Options to "Send Immediately" or "Schedule for Later" (with a date and time picker).
A final "Send" button.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Creating a Segment (Modal):
A powerful pop-up for building rules. It uses dropdowns: [Contact Field] [Condition] [Value]. For example: [Tag] [is] [Hot Lead]. You can add multiple AND/OR conditions.
Viewing a Report (Full Page):
A visual page with large numbers for Open Rate and Click Rate, a pie chart showing opens vs. unopens, and a clickable map showing where people opened the email.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent. All focus is on the campaign data and builder.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Newsletter" Flow: A user's most common task. They go through the 4-step Campaign Builder wizard. They design their email, choose their "All Subscribers" list, schedule it to send on Tuesday morning, and then come back on Wednesday to the Reports page to see how many people opened it.
The "Welcome Series" Flow (Automation): A user wants to automatically welcome new subscribers. They go to Automation -> Workflows. They create a new workflow. The Trigger is "When a contact is added to the list 'New Subscribers'." The first Action is "Wait 1 hour." The second Action is "Send Email 'Welcome Email #1'." They add another "Wait 2 days" and another "Send Email" action to create a whole series. They click "Activate," and now every new subscriber will automatically receive this series of emails without any more work.
The "CRM Integration" Flow: Inside Aura CRM, a user creates a list of all contacts who have a "Deal" in the "Proposal Sent" stage. They click a button "Sync to Aura Campaigns." This list of hot leads is now available in Aura Campaigns. The user then sends a special, targeted email to just this segment with a final offer to close the deal.
