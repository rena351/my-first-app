6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Daily Login" Flow: A user needs to log into a website. They go to the login page. The Aura Vault Browser Extension automatically detects the page, shows a small icon in the username field, and when clicked, auto-fills their username and password. The user just has to click "Login."
The "New Team Member" Flow: A new developer joins the team. The IT manager adds them to the "Developers" group in Aura Vault. This action automatically gives the new developer access to the "Server Credentials" and "Database Passwords" Chambers. The developer can now do their job without ever having to ask someone to send them a password in a chat message.
The "Security Audit" Flow: A manager wants to improve the team's security. They go to the Security Dashboard. They see that 5 users are reusing the same password across multiple sites. They can then send a notification to those users, asking them to update their weak passwords.
The "Offboarding" Flow (Security): An employee leaves the company. The admin deactivates their Aura Vault account. This instantly revokes their access to all shared Chambers and secrets, securing the company's data.
