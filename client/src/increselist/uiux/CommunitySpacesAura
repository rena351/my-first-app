6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Ask a Question" Flow: A user has a question about a product. They go to the Aura Community, find the "# Q&A" Channel, and click New Post. They write their question. A few hours later, another, more experienced user (a "power user") replies with a helpful answer. The original user marks the reply as the "Best Answer," which helps future users with the same question. This workflow reduces the burden on the official support team in Aura Desk.
The "Feedback" Flow: A product manager wants to get feedback on a new feature idea. They create a new post in the "# Feature Requests" channel explaining the idea and adding a Poll to gauge interest. Community members vote and leave detailed comments with their thoughts. The product manager now has valuable, real-world feedback to guide their development.
The "Engagement" Flow (Gamification): A user consistently provides helpful answers to questions. The system automatically awards them points for each "Best Answer" they receive. When they reach 1,000 points, they are automatically awarded the "Community Expert" Badge, which appears on their profile, and they move up the Leaderboard. This encourages positive and helpful behavior.
