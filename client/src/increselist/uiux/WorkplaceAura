The "Start of the Day" Flow: An employee arrives at work (or opens their laptop at home). The first page they open is the Aura Workplace Dashboard. In a single, 30-second scan, they know everything they need to for the day: they see they have 2 new emails, 1 unread chat message from their manager, a meeting at 10 AM, and 3 tasks due. They are fully prepared for their day without having to open 5 different applications.
The "Find That File" Flow: A user remembers a conversation about the "Q3 Marketing Budget" but can't remember if it was in an email, a chat, or a spreadsheet. They use the Global Search Bar in Aura Workplace. The search results appear in a unified, categorized list:
Mail: 3 emails with that subject.
Cliq: 1 channel conversation where it was mentioned.
WorkDrive: 1 spreadsheet file named "Q3 Marketing Budget.xlsx".
The user can find what they need in seconds.
The "Seamless Creation" Flow: While looking at their dashboard, a user realizes they need to write a quick document. They click the global + button, select New Document. This opens the full Aura Writer application in a new tab, ready to go.
