6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Digital Product" Flow: A user has written an ebook. They go to Aura Checkout and click New Payment Page. They set the price to "$19" (one-time). In the settings, they configure an automatic email to be sent after a successful payment, which contains the download link for the ebook. They get a public URL for their new checkout page and put it on their website.
The "Consulting Retainer" Flow: A consultant agrees to a monthly retainer with a client. They create a new payment page, set the price to "$500," and select the "Recurring" option with a "Monthly" frequency. They send the unique link to their client. The client enters their card details once, and now Aura Checkout will automatically charge them $500 every month, saving the consultant from having to send manual invoices.
The "Quick Invoice" Flow: A user in Aura Books creates an invoice for a customer. They click a "Generate Payment Link" button. This automatically creates a temporary, pre-filled Aura Checkout page with the exact invoice amount. The user includes this link in the invoice email, giving the customer an instant, easy way to pay online.
