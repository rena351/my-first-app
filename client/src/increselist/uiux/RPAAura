3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The RPA Studio)
The core of the application is the RPA Studio, which is a separate, downloadable desktop application for building the bots. The web interface is for managing and monitoring them.
The RPA Studio Interface (Desktop App):
Main Panel (The Workflow): A visual, flowchart-like canvas where the developer drags and drops actions to build the bot's logic.
Left Panel (Actions Library): A library of hundreds of pre-built actions, grouped by category:
Desktop Automation: Open Application, Click UI Element, Type Text, Get Text.
Web Automation: Open Browser, Click Link, Extract Data from Table.
Excel Automation: Open Spreadsheet, Read Cell, Write Cell.
Logic: If/Else conditions, Loops.
Top Toolbar: A "Record" button.
The Recorder: The magic feature. The developer clicks Record, then performs the task manually on their computer. The RPA Studio watches them and automatically creates the workflow steps on the canvas.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Configuring an Action (in the Studio): When a developer drags an action (like "Click UI Element") onto the canvas, a properties panel opens. They use a special "selector" tool to click on the button they want the bot to click in the target application, and the Studio automatically captures its unique identifier.
Scheduling a Job (on the Web): The Schedules page has a "New Schedule" button that opens a modal with options to run a process "Daily," "Weekly," or "On a Trigger," and to select which Bot should run it.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Legacy System" Flow: A company has an old accounting application that runs on a Windows desktop and has no API. Every day, an employee has to manually run a report in this app, save it as an Excel file, and then email it to the manager. To automate this, a developer uses the RPA Studio Recorder. They click Record, perform all the manual steps, and then stop the recording. The Studio creates a complete workflow. They publish this Process to the cloud. In the web interface, they Schedule it to run every morning at 8:00 AM on a specific computer in the office. The entire daily reporting task is now fully automated.
The "Data Scraping" Flow: A marketing team needs to get a list of all the vendors from a public website. The website has no "Export" button. A developer builds a bot in the RPA Studio. The bot's workflow is: 1. Open Browser and go to the website. 2. Loop through each page of the vendor directory. 3. Inside the loop, use the Extract Data from Table action to scrape the vendor names and websites. 4. Write the data to a new row in an Aura Sheet spreadsheet. The bot runs and builds a complete list of 1,000 vendors in 10 minutes.
The "Attended Bot" Flow: A customer service agent frequently has to copy a customer's ID from Aura Desk, switch to an old mainframe application, paste the ID to look up their order history, and then copy the history back into the Aura Desk ticket. The company provides them with an "Attended Bot." Now, when they are on a ticket, they can click a button on their desktop. The bot instantly performs all those copy-paste-switch steps for them in under a second, saving them time and reducing errors on every single ticket.
