3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Form Builder)
The core of this application is the Form Builder, which is a three-panel interface.
Left Panel (Add Fields):
A drag-and-drop library of all available form fields.
Basic Fields: Single Line Text, Multi-Line Text, Number, Dropdown, Radio Buttons, Checkboxes.
Advanced Fields: Name, Address, Email, Phone, Date/Time, File Upload, Digital Signature, Payment.
Layout Fields: Section Break, Page Break.
Center Panel (The Canvas):
A live, visual preview of the form as you are building it.
You drag fields from the left panel and drop them here.
You can click on any field to open its settings in the right panel.
Right Panel (Field Settings):
When you click a field on the canvas, this panel appears.
Properties: Change the Field Label, Placeholder Text, make it a Required field.
Validation: Set rules (e.g., "Must be a valid email," "Number must be between 1 and 100").
Top Tabs within the Builder:
Builder: The main design canvas.
Rules: A screen to create conditional logic (e.g., "If the user selects 'USA' in the Country field, then show the 'State' field").
Themes: A tool to customize the form's appearance (colors, fonts, background image).
Integrations: A page to connect the form to other AURA apps. This is critical. For example: "When a form is submitted, create a new Lead in Aura CRM." or "When a payment is made, create a new Invoice in Aura Books."
Share: A page that gives you the public link to the form and the code to embed it on a website.
4. Data Entry & Modals
The primary data entry is the form itself (what the end-user sees).
Viewing an Entry (Modal): On the "All Entries" page, clicking on a submission opens a clean, read-only modal pop-up showing all the data submitted for that specific entry.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent. The focus is entirely on the builder and the form data.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Create a Contact Form" Flow: The user's most basic job. They click New Form, drag on "Name," "Email," and "Message" fields. They go to the "Share" tab, copy the link, and send it to someone.
The "Event Registration" Flow (Advanced): The user creates a multi-page form. Page 1 collects personal info. Page 2 asks for session choices. Page 3 is a Payment field to collect the registration fee. They set up an Integration so that when the form is submitted, a new Contact is created in Aura CRM and an Invoice is created in Aura Books.
The "Analyze Feedback" Flow: The user has a "Customer Satisfaction" form. After 100 people have filled it out, the user goes to the Reports section, creates a new report, and builds a pie chart to visualize the answers to the "How would you rate our service?" question.
