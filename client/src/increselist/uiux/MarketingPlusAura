The "CMO's Daily Briefing" Flow: A marketing director starts their day by opening the Aura Marketing Plus Dashboard. In a single view, they see how many new leads were generated yesterday, which channels they came from, and how the main "Welcome Series" journey is performing. They can see the entire marketing engine's health without logging into 5 different apps.
The "Campaign Planning" Flow: A marketing team is planning their Q4 product launch. They use the unified Marketing Calendar to schedule all their activities. They drag and drop to plan the launch day blog post, the week-long social media teaser campaign, the announcement email blast, and the follow-up webinar. Everyone on the team can see the entire campaign timeline in one place.
The "Full Funnel ROI" Flow (Integrated): A user wants to know if their social media efforts are actually making money. They go to the Reports section in Marketing Plus. They run the "Full Funnel Analytics" report. This report automatically:
Pulls "Ad Spend" data from their ad platform integration.
Pulls "Clicks and Engagement" data from Aura Social.
Pulls "Leads Generated" data from Aura LandingPage.
Pulls "Leads Nurtured" data from Aura Marketing Automation.
Pulls "Deals Won and Revenue" data from Aura CRM.
It then presents a single, clear report showing the exact ROI of their social media campaign.
