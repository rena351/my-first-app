The "Setup" Flow: The user's first job is to set up their workshop. They go to Services to define what they offer. Then they go to Staff to add their team and set their individual working hours in the Availability section. Finally, they go to the Booking Page settings to customize its look and get the public URL.
The "Customer Booking" Flow: A customer receives the public booking link. They go through the simple steps of choosing a service and time and fill in their details. The appointment is automatically added to the company's calendar and the staff member's calendar (via two-way sync). Automated reminder emails are scheduled to be sent to the customer before the appointment.
The "Internal Booking" Flow: A staff member is on the phone with a customer who wants to book. The staff member clicks the + New Appointment button on their internal Calendar page. A modal pops up where they can select the service, customer (or create a new one), and time slot on behalf of the customer, and the booking is confirmed instantly.
