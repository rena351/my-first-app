Sending a Message (Modal): The Send Message action opens a simple pop-up where the admin can type a message that will be instantly pushed to the device's lock screen.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Employee" Flow: A new employee receives their company iPhone. The IT admin uses the Enrollment feature to add the device's serial number. When the employee turns on the phone for the first time, it automatically enrolls itself in Aura MDM. The system then automatically pushes all the necessary apps (Aura Mail, Aura Cliq), configures the company Wi-Fi, and applies the standard security policy, all without the IT admin ever touching the physical device.
The "Lost Phone" Flow (Security): An employee reports that their phone has been lost or stolen. The IT admin immediately goes to that device's detail page in Aura MDM. First, they click Lock Device to secure it with a passcode and display a "Please return to..." message on the screen. They also check its last known location on the map. If it seems unrecoverable, they click the Wipe Device button. This sends a command to remotely erase all data on the phone, protecting the company's sensitive information.
The "App Deployment" Flow: The company develops a new internal app. The IT admin uploads the app file to the App Management catalog in Aura MDM. They then assign the app to the "Sales Team" Group. The new app is automatically and silently installed on every salesperson's phone, without the users having to do anything.
