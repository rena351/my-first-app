6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Website Down" Flow (Automation): The Aura Commerce website suddenly goes offline. Within 60 seconds, Aura Site24x7's global monitoring locations detect the outage. The system automatically triggers a "Down" Alarm. Based on the Alert Configuration, it immediately sends a high-priority message to the #dev-ops channel in Aura Cliq and starts making phone calls to the on-call engineers. The team is aware of the problem before the first customer even notices.
The "Slow Server" Flow: An IT admin notices on the Dashboard that the CPU usage for the main database server is consistently high. They click on the server to go to its Monitor Detail page. They look at the Processes tab and identify a specific process that is consuming all the resources. They can then use Aura Assist to securely connect to that server and fix the problem.
The "Root Cause Analysis" Flow: After an outage, a manager wants to know what happened. They go to Aura Site24x7. They look at the Outages tab for the website to see the exact timeline. Then they go to the Log Management section and search for all error logs from the web servers during that exact time period. They are able to correlate the outage with a specific error in the logs, identifying the root cause of the problem.
