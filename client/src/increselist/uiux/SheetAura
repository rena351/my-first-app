Right-Side Collaboration Panel:
A collapsible panel with tabs for Comments (where you can @mention colleagues on specific cells) and Sharing (to manage who has access).
Bottom Bar (Sheet Tabs):
Tabs at the bottom to switch between different sheets within the same spreadsheet file. A + button allows you to add a new sheet.
4. Data Entry & Modals
The Grid: The primary data entry is typing directly into the cells. Typing = starts a formula, and the application provides formula suggestions.
Chart Builder (Modal/Side Panel): Clicking "Insert Chart" opens a powerful builder. The AI often suggests a chart type, but the user can customize everything from the data range to the colors and labels.
Data Validation (Modal): A pop-up that allows a user to set strict rules for a cell or range of cells (e.g., "Must be a number greater than 0," "Must be a valid date," "Must be from a list").
5. Bottom Bar
A thin status bar at the very bottom can show quick calculations for a selected range of cells, such as Sum, Average, and Count.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Budgeting" Flow: A user starts from the "Monthly Budget" Template. They enter their income and expenses in the designated cells. The spreadsheet's pre-built formulas automatically calculate the totals and show them if they are over or under budget in different categories. They use Conditional Formatting to automatically turn any negative number red.
The "Data Analysis" Flow: A user imports a large CSV file of sales data. It's messy. They use the Data Cleaning tools to remove duplicates and fix inconsistencies. Then, they select all the data and click the Insights button. The Zia AI instantly generates a dashboard of charts and pivot tables, showing them "Sales by Country" and "Top Performing Products," insights that would have taken hours to create manually.
The "Collaborative Planning" Flow: A project manager creates a new spreadsheet to plan a product launch. They Share it with the marketing, sales, and development teams, giving them all "Edit" access. Each team fills in their respective tasks and timelines in different sections. The manager can see all the updates happening in real-time. They use the Comments feature to ask questions and resolve issues directly within the sheet, creating a single source of truth for the entire plan.
