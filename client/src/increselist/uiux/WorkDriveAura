6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Project" Flow: A manager starts a new project. They go to Team Folders and create a new folder called "Project Phoenix." They click on the folder, and in the right panel, they add the 5 team members who will be working on it, giving them all "Edit" access. Now, the entire team has a single, centralized place to store all their project files.
The "Collaborative Document" Flow: A user opens the "Project Phoenix" folder and clicks + New -> Document. Aura Writer opens in a new tab, and the new document is automatically saved inside this shared folder. The user starts writing the project plan. They @mention a colleague in a comment. That colleague gets a notification in Aura Cliq with a direct link to the document. The colleague clicks the link, opens the document, and they can both edit it at the same time, seeing each other's cursors.
The "Secure Sharing" Flow: A user finishes a proposal document. They need to send it to an external client for review, but they don't want the client to be able to edit or download it. They click Share on the document. In the modal, they go to the "External Link" tab. They set the permission to View Only, set an Expiration Date for 7 days, and Set a password. They then copy this secure link and send it to the client.
