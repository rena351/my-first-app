3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Data Prep Studio)
The core of the application is the Data Prep Studio, which opens when you select a dataset to work on.
Top Bar: Displays the name of the dataset.
Main View (The Data Grid):
A large, spreadsheet-like grid showing a preview of your data.
Crucial Feature: Above each column header is a Data Quality Bar that visually shows what percentage of the data in that column is valid, invalid, or missing.
Right Panel (Transformations & Recipe):
This is the main control panel.
AI Suggestions: At the top, the AI (Zia) automatically suggests cleaning operations based on its analysis of the data (e.g., "This column looks like a date but is formatted as text. Convert to Date?").
Transformations Library: A searchable list of hundreds of pre-built data transformations, grouped by category:
Cleanse: Remove Duplicates, Fill Missing Values, Trim Whitespace.
Transform: Split Column, Merge Columns, Format Date, Extract Text.
Enrich: Join with another dataset.
Recipe: As you apply transformations, each step is automatically added to a "Recipe" list at the bottom. This creates a reusable, editable workflow. You can undo, reorder, or delete steps from the recipe.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Import Data (Wizard): A multi-step wizard to connect to a new data source. It provides a live preview of the data and allows you to select which tables or sheets to import.
Transformation Configuration (Modal): Clicking on a transformation (e.g., "Split Column") opens a modal pop-up with specific options (e.g., "Split by which delimiter?", "How many new columns to create?").
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Messy CSV" Flow: A user uploads a CSV file of sales leads. They open it in the Data Prep Studio. The Data Quality Bar for the "Phone Number" column is mostly red, showing many invalid entries. The AI Suggests a transformation to "Standardize Phone Numbers to a consistent format." The user clicks "Apply." Next, they see the "Full Name" column. They use the "Split Column" transformation to split it into "First Name" and "Last Name" columns. They see that many "Country" fields are misspelled. They use the "Cluster and Merge" tool to group similar values (like "U.S.A." and "United States") and merge them into one consistent value. Once the data is clean, they click "Export" and send the prepared dataset directly to Aura CRM.
The "Automated ETL" Flow (Advanced): A data engineer needs to combine sales data from Aura Commerce with support data from Aura Desk every night. They create a new Project. They connect to both data sources. They build a Recipe that joins the two datasets, calculates a new "Customer Health Score" column, and removes unneeded columns. They then go to the Schedules page and set this recipe to run every night at 2:00 AM. The final, cleaned dataset is automatically exported to a "Master Customer Table" in Aura Analytics for the executive team to view in their dashboards the next morning.
