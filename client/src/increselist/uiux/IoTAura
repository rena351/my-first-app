1. Universal Top Bar (Consistent Across All AURA Apps)
AURA Logo / App Switcher: Clicking shows other AURA apps.
Current App Name: "Aura IoT"
Global Search Bar: Placeholder: "Search by device ID, location, or metric..."
Quick Create Button (+ Icon) (Admin/Dev only):

2. Aura IoT Internal Sidebar
This sidebar is for the administrator, developer, or operations manager.
Section: Home
Icon: Home
Pages:
Dashboard: The main operations dashboard. A customizable, map-based view showing the real-time status and location of all connected devices. Widgets for "Online vs. Offline Devices," "Active Alerts," and key performance indicator (KPI) gauges.
Section: Device Management
Icon: Cpu
Pages:
Devices: The master inventory of all connected hardware devices. Each device has a detailed profile showing its unique ID, status, last-heard-from time, and current data readings.
Device Groups: A page to organize devices by type, location, or customer.
Firmware Updates (OTA): A powerful tool to remotely send software updates "over-the-air" to the entire fleet of devices.
Section: Data & Analytics
Icon: Database
Pages:
Data Streams: A real-time log viewer showing the raw data flowing in from all devices.
Dashboards: A visual, drag-and-drop builder to create custom dashboards with charts, gauges, and maps to visualize the IoT data (integrates with Aura Analytics).
Section: Automation
Icon: Zap
Pages:
Rules Engine: The core of the automation. A page to create "if-this-then-that" rules based on incoming device data.
Alerts: A log of all alerts that have been triggered by the rules engine.
Actions: A list of the actions that can be triggered (e.g., "Send an Email," "Send an SMS," "Make an API Call" to another AURA app).
Section: Developer Tools
Icon: Code
Pages:
API & SDKs: A page with API keys, documentation, and software development kits (SDKs) to help hardware engineers connect their devices to the Aura IoT platform.
3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface
On the "Device Details" Page:
A dashboard for a single device.
Tabs: Live Data, Historical Data (with charts), Configuration, Logs, Commands.
Action Toolbar: Buttons to Reboot Device, Send Command, Update Firmware.
The "Rule Builder" (Wizard):
A multi-step, form-based wizard to create a new automation rule.
Step 1: Condition (The "IF"): IF a Device from Group 'Factory Sensors' sends a Metric 'Temperature' that is Greater Than Value '100'.
Step 2: Action (The "THEN"): THEN Send an SMS to +91... with the message "Warning: Factory temperature is critical!" AND Create a new Ticket in Aura Desk.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Sending a Command (Modal): A secure pop-up where an admin can type a specific command string to send to a remote device. Requires confirmation.
The Dashboard Builder: A drag-and-drop canvas where users can add widgets (Line Chart, Gauge, Map, Indicator Light) and configure them to display specific data from their devices.
5. Bottom Bar
A thin status bar showing the total number of connected devices and the rate of incoming messages.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Cold Storage Monitoring" Flow: A company has temperature sensors in its refrigerated trucks. The sensors are registered as Devices in Aura IoT. An operations manager creates a Rule: "If the temperature from any truck sensor goes above 5Â°C, trigger a high-priority Alert." One day, a truck's refrigeration fails. Aura IoT instantly detects the temperature rise, triggers the rule, and sends an SMS to the driver and an email to the manager, allowing them to save the cargo before it spoils.
The "Predictive Maintenance" Flow: A factory connects vibration sensors to its heavy machinery. The data is streamed to Aura IoT. An analyst uses the Dashboards to create a chart of the vibration levels over time. They notice that a specific machine's vibrations are slowly but consistently increasing. This is a sign of a future breakdown. They create a Work Order in Aura FSM to schedule maintenance before the machine fails, preventing costly downtime.
The "Smart Agriculture" Flow (Integration): A farm has soil moisture sensors in its fields. The data is sent to Aura IoT. A rule is set up that connects to Aura Flow. When the moisture level in a field drops below a certain point, the rule triggers a workflow in Aura Flow that sends an API command to the farm's smart irrigation system, automatically turning on the sprinklers for that specific field for 30 minutes.
