6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Behind-the-Scenes Payment" Flow (Automation): A customer is on the Aura Checkout page and clicks "Pay Now." The Checkout app sends a secure request to the Aura Payments app. Aura Payments looks at its Routing Rules, chooses the best gateway (e.g., Stripe), securely sends the payment information to Stripe, gets a "Success" response, records the transaction in its Transactions log, and then tells the Checkout app that the payment was successful. The customer sees a "Thank You" message. This entire process happens in under 2 seconds.
The "Dispute Management" Flow: A customer files a chargeback with their credit card company. The payment gateway notifies Aura Payments. A new item appears in the Disputes & Chargebacks list. The finance manager gets a notification. They click on the dispute, which shows them the original transaction and order details from Aura Commerce. They use the interface to upload evidence (like a shipping confirmation) to fight the chargeback.
The "Gateway Failover" Flow (Automation): A customer tries to pay, but the primary gateway (Stripe) is temporarily down. Aura Payments receives an error. The Routing Rules automatically tell it to retry the same transaction with the secondary gateway (PayPal). The payment succeeds. The customer experiences no interruption, and the business does not lose the sale.
