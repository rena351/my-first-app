6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Phishing Attack" Flow (Automated): A phishing email is sent to 100 employees. Aura eProtect's gateway scans the incoming email. Its Anti-Phishing engine recognizes the malicious link. The system automatically blocks all 100 emails and places them in the Quarantine. The IT admin receives a single alert about the blocked attack. No employees are ever put at risk.
The "Data Leak Prevention" Flow (Automated): An employee accidentally tries to email a spreadsheet containing a list of customer credit card numbers to their personal Gmail account. The DLP policy engine scans the outbound email and its attachment. It detects the credit card number pattern. It automatically blocks the email from being sent and sends a notification to both the employee ("This email was blocked due to a DLP policy violation") and the security manager.
The "Legal Discovery" Flow: The company is involved in a legal case. The legal team needs to find all emails sent by a specific employee about "Project Phoenix" in the last year. The compliance officer goes to Aura eProtect, opens the Search (eDiscovery) page, and enters the search criteria. The system searches the entire, unchangeable archive and produces a list of all relevant emails, which can then be exported and provided to the legal team.
