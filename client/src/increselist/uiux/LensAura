3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Expert Console)
The core of the application is the Expert Console, which is the web interface the remote expert uses during a live session.
Main View:
A large, real-time video stream from the customer's phone camera.
Toolbar (at the bottom or side of the video stream):
Annotation Tools:
3D Arrow: Click and drag on the screen to place a persistent 3D arrow that "sticks" to a real-world object.
Draw Tool: Free-hand draw on the screen.
Text Tool: Add text labels onto the video.
Communication Tools:
VoIP Audio: Buttons to mute/unmute the microphone for talking to the customer.
Chat: A small text chat window for noisy environments.
Session Tools:
Freeze Frame: Pauses the live video, allowing the expert to draw on a still image with more precision.
Take Snapshot: Saves a high-resolution picture of the current view to the session log.
Flashlight: A button to remotely turn on the customer's phone flashlight.
Start Recording: A button to record the entire session.
AI Tools:
Scan Text (OCR): A button that tells the AI to read and copy any text visible in the video stream (like a serial number on a machine).
4. Data Entry & Modals
The Customer's Experience: The customer receives an SMS with a link. Tapping the link opens a webpage that asks for permission to use their camera and microphone. No app installation is required. Once permission is granted, their camera feed starts streaming to the expert.
Session Summary (Modal): When the expert ends the session, a modal pops up asking them to add Notes and Tags (e.g., "router-reset," "faulty-cable") to categorize the session for future reporting.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "IT Support" Flow: A customer calls because their Wi-Fi isn't working. The support agent in Aura Desk realizes they can't solve it over the phone. They initiate an Aura Lens session and send the link to the customer. The customer points their phone camera at their router. The remote expert says, "I see the problem." Using the Draw Tool, the expert circles the correct port on the router and says, "Unplug the yellow cable from here." Then, using a 3D Arrow, they point to a different port and say, "And plug it in right here." The customer follows the visual instructions, and the problem is solved in seconds.
The "Field Technician" Flow: A junior technician is on-site trying to repair a complex machine but is stuck. They start an Aura Lens session with a senior expert back at the head office. The junior tech points their phone camera inside the machine. The senior expert uses 3D annotations to guide the junior tech through the entire repair process, step by step, as if they were standing right there. The entire session is recorded and later added to the AR Guides library for training other new technicians.
The "Insurance Claim" Flow: An insurance agent needs to assess damage to a car after an accident. They send an Aura Lens link to the customer. The customer walks around their car, showing the damage through their phone's camera. The agent uses the Take Snapshot tool to capture high-quality evidence and uses the Scan Text (OCR) tool to instantly read the car's VIN and license plate number. The entire assessment is done in 5 minutes without the agent having to travel.
