6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Instant Sync" Flow: A user in Aura Cliq is chatting with two colleagues about a complex problem. The text chat is too slow. The user clicks a /meet slash command in the chat. Aura Meeting instantly creates a new meeting and posts the join link directly into the chat. All three colleagues click the link and are in a video call within 10 seconds.
The "Scheduled Client Call" Flow: A user needs to schedule a demo for a client in Aura CRM. They go to Aura Meeting and click Schedule Meeting. They give it a title and time. In the "Attendees" field, they start typing the client's name, and it auto-suggests the contact from Aura CRM. They schedule the meeting. The system automatically creates an event in Aura Calendar, sends a professional email invitation with the join link to the client, and logs the upcoming meeting on the client's timeline in Aura CRM.
The "Project Huddle" Flow: A developer is working in their GitHub Codespace and needs to show their screen to a teammate. They start an instant meeting, share their screen, and walk through the code. The teammate uses the Annotation tools (part of screen sharing) to draw a circle around a bug in the code. The problem is identified and solved in minutes. After the meeting, the host finds the session in their Recordings library and shares a link with the rest of the team so they can see the solution.
