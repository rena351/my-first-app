A persistent "Timer" widget might be present at the bottom, allowing team members to easily start and stop a timer for any job they are working on.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Client Onboarding" Flow: A new client signs up. A manager in Aura Practice clicks New Job and selects the "New Client Onboarding" Template. This automatically creates 10 tasks, such as "Send Engagement Letter," "Request Prior Year Tax Docs," and assigns them to the appropriate team members with due dates. The engagement letter is sent for e-signature through the Aura Sign integration.
The "Tax Season" Flow: The firm is managing hundreds of tax returns. The Jobs Kanban board gives the partners a high-level view of where every single return is in the process. A tax preparer finishes a return and drags the job card from "In Progress" to "In Review." This automatically notifies the reviewing manager that the return is ready for their review.
The "Monthly Billing" Flow: At the end of the month, the firm admin goes to the Billing page. They see a summary of all unbilled hours and expenses for every client. They can review the time logs, and with a few clicks, generate and send professional invoices for all the work done that month, pulling the data directly from the Time Tracking module.
