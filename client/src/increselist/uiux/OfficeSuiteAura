3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface
On the "All Files" Page:
Title: "All Files"
Toolbar: Buttons for + New (dropdown for file type), New Folder, Upload File.
Main View: A list or grid of files and folders. Each file has a clear icon indicating its type (Writer, Sheet, or Show). Clicking on a file does not open it in a modal. Instead, it navigates the user away from the Office Suite dashboard and opens the full, dedicated application (Aura Writer, Aura Sheet, or Aura Show) in the browser.
4. Data Entry & Modals
This application has very little data entry itself. Its primary job is to launch the other applications.
Creating a New Folder (Modal): A simple pop-up that just asks for the folder name.
5. Bottom Bar
A thin bar at the bottom might show the user's total storage usage from Aura WorkDrive.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Start the Day" Flow: A user's first action is to open the Aura Office Suite. They land on the Dashboard. In the "Recent Files" feed, they see the "Quarterly Report" spreadsheet they were working on yesterday. They click it. The browser navigates them directly into the full Aura Sheet application, with the spreadsheet open and ready to edit.
The "New Project" Flow: A user needs to create three new files for a project: a proposal, a budget, and a presentation. They go to the Aura Office Suite. They navigate to the correct project folder within the All Files view. They click the + New button and select Document to create the proposal in Aura Writer. They come back to the Office Suite tab, click + New again, and select Spreadsheet to create the budget in Aura Sheet. All files are automatically saved in the correct project folder.
The "Find Anything" Flow: A user remembers they wrote about "Project Phoenix" somewhere, but they can't remember if it was in a document, a spreadsheet, or a presentation. They go to the Aura Office Suite and use the Global Search Bar. They type "Project Phoenix." The search results appear in a unified list, showing a Writer document named "Project Phoenix Proposal," a Sheet named "Project Phoenix Budget," and a Show presentation that mentions the project in its slide notes.
