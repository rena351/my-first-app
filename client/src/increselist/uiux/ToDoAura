The "Daily Planning" Flow: A user starts their day. They look at their Planned and Assigned to Me lists. For each important task they want to work on, they open its detail panel and click Add to My Day. They then switch to the My Day view, which now shows a clean, focused list of 5-7 tasks, helping them avoid feeling overwhelmed.
The "Shared Shopping List" Flow: A user creates a new list called Groceries and shares it with their family members. Everyone can add items to the list from their phone. When one person is at the store, they open the shared list and can see everything that needs to be bought.
The "Email to Task" Flow (Integration): A user receives an important email in Aura Mail that requires an action. They flag the email. An automation rule (set up in Aura Flow) automatically creates a new task in their Aura ToDo Inbox list, with the email's subject as the task title and a link back to the original email in the notes.
