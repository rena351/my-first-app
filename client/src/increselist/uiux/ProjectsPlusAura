6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Executive's Weekly Review" Flow: A CTO starts their week by opening the Aura Projects Plus Dashboard. They can instantly see the health of all 20 active projects. They notice one project is "Off Track." They click on it and are taken directly to that project's detailed dashboard within the full Aura Projects app to investigate the cause.
The "Developer's Daily Standup" Flow: A developer starts their day. Instead of opening three different apps, they go to the My Tasks page in Projects Plus. This single page shows them:
The two user stories assigned to them in the current sprint from Aura Sprints.
The one critical bug they need to fix from Aura BugTracker.
A general project task assigned to them from Aura Projects.
They have a single, prioritized to-do list for their entire day.
The "Resource Planning" Flow: A manager is planning a new project but doesn't know if their team has the capacity to work on it. They go to the Resource Management dashboard in Projects Plus. They see a visual chart of every person on their team and how many hours they are allocated to for the next three months. They see that their lead developer is 120% allocated, while a junior developer is only 50% allocated. They can now make an informed decision about project timelines and staffing.
