6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Subscriber" Flow: A potential customer on your website clicks "Subscribe to Pro Plan." They are taken to a secure Hosted Checkout Page powered by Aura Subscriptions. They enter their credit card details. The system processes the payment, creates a new Customer and a new Subscription record, and automatically sends a welcome email. Their MRR on the Dashboard instantly increases.
The "Automatic Renewal" Flow: On the first day of the month, Aura Subscriptions automatically looks at all subscriptions that are due for renewal. It generates an Invoice for each one and automatically charges the customer's saved payment method. A receipt is automatically emailed to the customer. This happens for thousands of customers with zero manual work.
The "Failed Payment" Flow (Dunning): A customer's credit card expires. The automatic renewal charge fails. The Dunning Management system automatically kicks in. It sends an email to the customer: "Your payment failed. Please update your payment method." It will then automatically retry the charge every 3 days. If it still fails after 4 attempts, the system will automatically cancel the subscription to prevent revenue loss.
The "Self-Service Upgrade" Flow: A customer on the "Basic Plan" decides they need more features. They log into the Customer Portal. They see their current subscription and click a button that says "Upgrade Plan." They select the "Pro Plan" from a list. The system shows them the prorated charge for the rest of the month. They confirm, and their plan is instantly upgraded, and they get access to the new features.
