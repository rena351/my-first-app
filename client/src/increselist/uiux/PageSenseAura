6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Why Aren't People Clicking?" Flow: A user wonders why nobody is clicking their "Request a Demo" button. They create a Heatmap for their homepage. The heatmap visually shows that users are clicking on a non-clickable image right next to the button. The user realizes the design is confusing and uses this insight to improve the page.
The "Improve Conversions" Flow: A user wants to improve their pricing page. They go to A/B Testing and create a new experiment. In the Original version, the button says "Sign Up." In the Variation, they use the Visual Editor to change the button text to "Start Your Free Trial." They set the Goal to be a click on that button. After running the test for a week, Aura PageSense tells them that "Start Your Free Trial" resulted in a 30% increase in conversions, and they can confidently make that change permanent.
The "Find a Bug" Flow: A customer emails support saying they can't complete a form. The developer goes to Session Recordings and filters for users who encountered an error on that form page. They watch a recording and see the user's mouse repeatedly clicking a broken button, visually identifying a bug that was hard to reproduce.
