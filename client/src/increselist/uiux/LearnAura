6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Hire Onboarding" Flow (Automation): A new employee is added to the "New Hires" Group in Aura People. This automatically triggers an enrollment in the "New Hire Onboarding" Learning Path in Aura Learn. The new employee receives a welcome email with a link to their dashboard. They see a structured path of courses they need to complete in their first week, such as "Company History," "Code of Conduct," and "IT Security Basics."
The "Authoring" Flow: A department expert needs to create a new training course. They go to the Admin view, click Create Course. They use the Course Builder to structure their course into modules and lessons. They upload a video they recorded in Aura Meeting, write a text summary in an embedded Aura Writer, and create a 10-question Quiz to test understanding. Once finished, they publish the course to the Course Catalog for others to take.
The "Compliance Training" Flow: A compliance officer needs to ensure every employee completes the annual "Data Privacy" training. They go to Aura Learn, select the course, and enroll the "All Employees" group with a deadline of December 31st. The system sends out initial and reminder emails. The officer can then go to the Reports page to see a real-time list of who has and has not completed the mandatory training.
