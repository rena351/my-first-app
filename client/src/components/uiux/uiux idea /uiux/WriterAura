6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Collaborative Report" Flow: A manager starts a new document for a "Quarterly Report" using a Template. They Share the document with their team, giving them "Comment" access. Team members go through the document and add comments and suggestions. The manager reviews the comments, accepts or rejects the changes, and finalizes the document.
The "Mail Merge" Flow (Automation): The HR team needs to send personalized offer letters to 100 new candidates. They create one master Template in Aura Writer. They use the Mail Merge feature to connect it to a spreadsheet of candidate data (from Aura Sheet). With one click, Aura Writer generates 100 unique, personalized letters.
The "Contract" Flow (Integration): A salesperson finalizes a contract in Aura Writer. They use the Send for e-Signature button. This automatically sends the document to Aura Sign. Once the client signs the document, the legally binding, completed PDF is automatically saved back into Aura WorkDrive and attached to the customer's record in Aura CRM.
The "AI-Powered Writing" Flow: A user has written a long, complex blog post. They open the Zia panel. The AI assistant gives the document a poor Readability score and highlights several sentences that are too long. It suggests simpler phrasing. The user accepts the suggestions, and the document becomes much clearer and easier to read.
