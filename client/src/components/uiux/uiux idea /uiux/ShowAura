6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Sales Pitch" Flow: A salesperson needs to create a pitch deck. They go to Aura Show and start from the "Sales Pitch" Template. They use the Master Slides to add their company logo to every slide at once. They go to Aura Analytics, take a screenshot of a key performance chart, and paste it into a slide. They then Share the presentation with their manager, who leaves Comments with feedback.
The "Team Meeting" Flow: For a weekly team meeting, the manager opens a presentation. They click Present and then Share Screen in Aura Meeting. The whole team can see the slides.
The "Live Webinar" Flow (Integration): A marketer is hosting a webinar. They start the broadcast in Aura Webinar. Inside the webinar studio, they click a "Share" button and select their Aura Show presentation. The presentation is streamed directly to the audience. The marketer uses the Presenter View on their own screen to see their notes and guide the presentation.
