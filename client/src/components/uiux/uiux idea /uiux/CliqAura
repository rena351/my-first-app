6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Quick Question" Flow: A developer has a quick question for a designer. Instead of writing a formal email, they open Aura Cliq, find the designer in their Contacts, and send a direct message: "Hey, what is the hex code for our primary blue color?" The designer sees the message pop up and replies instantly: "#3B82F6." The conversation takes 10 seconds instead of 10 minutes.
The "Project Update" Flow: A project manager needs to give an update to the whole team. They go to the #project-phoenix Channel and post a message: "@here Quick update: The client has approved the mockups! We are clear to start development." Every member of the channel gets a notification.
The "Urgent Alert" Flow (Automation): An error is detected on the company's server by Aura's monitoring tools. An automated Bot instantly posts a message into the #dev-ops-alerts channel: "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ERROR: Server CPU is at 99%! @on-call-engineer please investigate." The on-call engineer is immediately notified on their phone and can start working on the problem.
The "Message to Action" Flow: A manager posts in a channel: "Rohan, can you please prepare the sales report by Friday?" Rohan hovers over the message, clicks the "More Actions" (...) menu, and selects Create Task. This automatically creates a new task in Aura Projects titled "Prepare the sales report," with a due date of Friday, and a link back to the original Cliq message for context.
