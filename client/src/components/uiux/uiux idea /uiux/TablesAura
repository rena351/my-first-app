3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Base)
The core of the application is the Base, which is a single database that can contain multiple tables. The interface is highly interactive.
Top Bar within a Base:
Table Tabs: Tabs at the top to switch between the different tables within the base (e.g., "Tasks," "Projects," "Team Members").
View Tabs: Next to the table tabs, another set of tabs to switch between different Views of the current table's data.
The Main View (The Data Grid):
The default view is a powerful spreadsheet-like grid.
Columns are "Fields" with specific data types (Single line text, Date, Attachment, Checkbox, Single select, Link to another record).
Rows are individual "Records."
Toolbar above the Grid:
View Name: Shows the name of the current view.
View Controls: Buttons to Hide fields, Filter, Group, and Sort the records.
Collaboration: Icons showing the profile pictures of other team members currently viewing the base.
Automations: A button to open the automation panel.
Interfaces: A button to switch to the custom dashboard view.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Data Entry: Users can type directly into the grid cells, just like a spreadsheet.
Expanding a Record (Modal): Clicking on a row opens a modal pop-up that shows all the fields for that single record in a clean, vertical form. This is where users can see long text fields, view attachments, and have conversations in a "Comments" section.
The View Switcher: This is a key feature. A user can create a new View of their data without changing the underlying table. Common views include:
Form View: Instantly creates a shareable web form to collect new records.
Kanban View: Visualizes records as cards in a pipeline, grouped by a "Single select" field (like "Status").
Calendar View: Plots records on a calendar based on a "Date" field.
Gallery View: Displays records as large visual cards, perfect for image-heavy tables.
5. Bottom Bar
A thin status bar showing the number of records in the current view and summary calculations (like Sum or Average) for number fields.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Project Tracker" Flow: A user starts with the "Project Tracker" Template. This creates a Base with two linked tables: "Projects" and "Tasks." In the "Tasks" table, they create a Link to another record field that connects each task to a project. They create a Kanban View for their Tasks table, grouped by the "Status" field (To Do, In Progress, Done). As the team works, they drag task cards across the board.
The "Content Calendar" Flow: A marketing team creates a Base to manage their blog. They have a table with fields for "Article Title," "Author," "Status" (Draft, In Review, Published), and "Publish Date." They create a Calendar View based on the "Publish Date" field. This gives them a visual overview of their entire content schedule for the month. When an article is ready for review, they change its Status to "In Review."
The "Automation" Flow: In their Content Calendar, the team creates an Automation. The Trigger is "When a record's Status is updated to 'Published'." The Action is to "Send a message in the #marketing channel in Aura Cliq." Now, every time a new article goes live, the entire team is automatically notified.
