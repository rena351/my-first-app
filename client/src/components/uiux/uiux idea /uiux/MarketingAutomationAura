3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Journey Builder)
The most important interface is the Journey Builder, a large, visual, full-screen canvas.
Components of the Journey Builder:
Left Panel (Triggers & Actions):
Triggers (The "Start"): A list of events that can start a journey. (e.g., Fills out a Form, Is added to a List, Visits a Webpage). The user drags a trigger onto the canvas to begin.
Actions (The "Do"): A list of actions the system can take. (e.g., Send Email, Send SMS, Add a Tag, Update a Field in CRM).
Logic (The "Decide"): A list of logic controls. (e.g., Wait for a period of time, Check a Condition like "did they open the last email?", Split the path for an A/B test).
Center Panel (The Canvas):
The user drags triggers, actions, and logic from the left panel onto the canvas and connects them with lines to visually map out the entire customer journey.
Top Bar: Buttons to Save the journey, Test the journey, and Activate the journey.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Configuring an Action (Modal): When a user drags an action (like Send Email) onto the canvas, a modal pops up. It will have a dropdown to select the specific email campaign they want to send from their library.
Viewing Lead Activity (Side Panel): Clicking on a lead in the All Leads list opens a side panel showing a complete chronological timeline of every action that lead has ever taken: every email they've opened, every page they've visited, and every journey they have entered.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent. All focus is on the journey builder canvas.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Welcome Series" Flow: A user wants to create a 3-email welcome series for new subscribers. They open the Journey Builder. They drag the Fills out a Form trigger onto the canvas and select their "Newsletter Signup" form. They connect it to a Send Email action and choose their "Welcome Email #1". They connect that to a Wait action set to "2 days." They connect that to another Send Email action for "Welcome Email #2," and so on. Finally, they click Activate. The entire process is now automated.
The "Lead Nurturing" Flow (Advanced): A user wants to nurture leads who download an ebook. They create a journey triggered by a form submission. The journey sends a series of educational emails. It uses a Check a Condition logic block to see if a lead has visited the pricing page. If they have, the journey automatically adds a "Hot Lead" tag, updates their Lead Score to 100, and sends a notification to a sales rep in Aura CRM to follow up personally. If they haven't, the journey continues sending them more educational content.
The "Sales & Marketing Alignment" Flow: The Lead Scoring rules are set up. A lead from a marketing journey reaches a score of 100. This high score acts as a trigger in a workflow that automatically creates a new Deal in Aura CRM and assigns it to a sales representative, bridging the gap between marketing and sales.
