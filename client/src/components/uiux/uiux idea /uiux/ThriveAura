6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Loyalty Loop" Flow: A customer makes a purchase on your Aura Commerce site. Aura Thrive automatically sees this, and based on the Earning Rules, it adds points to the customer's account. The customer receives an email: "Congratulations! You've earned 100 points." Later, the customer logs in, sees they have enough points for a "$10 Off" reward, and clicks "Redeem." Aura Thrive automatically generates a unique coupon code and displays it to the customer, encouraging them to make another purchase.
The "Affiliate Onboarding" Flow: A blogger signs up for your affiliate program. You receive a notification in Aura Thrive and go to the Affiliates page. You review their website and click Approve. The blogger automatically receives a welcome email containing their unique affiliate link and a link to their Affiliate Portal.
The "Affiliate Sale" Flow: The blogger writes a post and includes their unique affiliate link. A reader clicks the link, comes to your Aura Commerce site, and buys a product. Aura Thrive tracks this click. After the purchase is complete, it automatically calculates the 10% commission and adds it to the blogger's "Unpaid Commissions" total in their portal.
