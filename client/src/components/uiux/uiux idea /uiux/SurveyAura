6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Create a Feedback Survey" Flow: A user clicks New Survey. They use the Builder to drag and drop questions. They add a Star Rating question and a Comment Box. They go to the Distribution tab, copy the public link, and email it to their customers.
The "Analyze Results" Flow: After a week, the user comes back and goes to the Reports tab for their survey. They see that the average rating is 4.2 stars. They look at the "Text Analytics" section and see that the AI has identified "Fast Delivery" as a positive theme and "Customer Support" as a negative theme, giving them instant, actionable insights.
The "Conditional Logic" Flow (Advanced): A user creates a survey. The first question is "Have you used our product?" They add Logic to this question. If the user answers "Yes," they are taken to a page of detailed questions about the product. If they answer "No," they are taken directly to the final "Thank You" page, skipping all the irrelevant questions. This creates a smarter, more respectful survey experience.
