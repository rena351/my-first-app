Pages:

3. Page-Level Toolbars

Title: "Sales Pipeline" (with a dropdown to switch to other pipelines).
Primary Button: + New Deal
View Switcher: Kanban View icon (default), List View icon.
Filters: "Filter by Owner," "Filter by Stage," "Filter by Closing Date."
On a "Single Deal Detail" View (often a pop-up or side panel):
Title: The Deal's Name (e.g., "AURA Website Project").
Key Info: Shows associated Contact, Company, Deal Value, and current Stage.
Action Buttons: Add Activity, Add Note, Edit Deal.
Timeline: A chronological feed of all activities related to this deal (emails, calls, stage changes).
4. Data Entry & Modals
Creating a New Deal (Quick Modal):
A simple pop-up form with essential fields: "Deal Name," "Contact Name," "Company Name," "Value," and "Pipeline Stage." Designed for very fast entry.
Adding an Activity (Modal Pop-up):
A simple form to add a Task, Event, or Call, directly linked to the current Deal, Contact, or Company.
5. Bottom Bar
Minimal or Non-existent: To keep the interface clean and focused, this app would likely have no persistent bottom bar. Information like record counts would be shown in the Page-Level Toolbar.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The Pipeline Flow: The user's entire life is on the Pipelines page. The main job is to move deal cards from left to right, from "New" to "Won." Every other feature exists to support this one core workflow.
The "Activity-Driven" Workflow: For each Deal card, the user's job is to ensure there is always a "Next Activity" scheduled. If a deal has no upcoming tasks, it is at risk. The user clicks a deal, clicks Add Activity, and schedules the next follow-up.
The "Quick-Create" Flow: A user gets a new lead from a phone call. They click the global + button, select New Deal, fill in 4-5 fields, and in 30 seconds, a new deal card appears in the first stage of their pipeline, ready to be worked on.
