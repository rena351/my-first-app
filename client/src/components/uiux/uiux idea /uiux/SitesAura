6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "First Website" Flow: A new user clicks New Site. They are first shown the Templates gallery and choose a design they like. The Builder opens, pre-filled with the template content. The user clicks on the text to change it to their company's name and clicks on the images to replace them with their own. They go to the Pages section, create a new "Contact Us" page, and drag a Form and a Map element onto it. Finally, they click the Publish button. Aura Sites gives them a temporary URL (like my-site.aurasites.com), and their new website is live.
The "Write a Blog Post" Flow: The user goes to the Blog section in the sidebar. They click New Post. This opens a simpler, more focused editor designed for writing articles. They write their post, add images, assign it to a category, and click Publish. The new post automatically appears on their website's main blog page.
The "Connect a Domain" Flow: After building their site, the user goes to the Domains section. They follow a step-by-step wizard that tells them the exact DNS records they need to add at their domain registrar (like GoDaddy) to point their custom domain to their new Aura Site.
