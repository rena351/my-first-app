3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Hiring Pipeline)
The most important interface is the Hiring Pipeline for a specific job opening.
Top Bar for a Selected Job Opening:
Displays the job title (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer").
Tabs to switch between different views for this job: Candidates, Details, Hiring Team, Analytics.
The "Candidates" View (Kanban Board):
A visual pipeline with columns for each stage of the hiring process.
Default Stages: New Applicant, Screening, Interview, Offer, Hired. These stages are customizable.
Candidate Cards: Each candidate is a draggable card. The card shows their name, photo, and key info.
The user's job is to drag these cards from left to right as a candidate progresses through the hiring process.
The "Candidate Profile" View (opens when you click a card):
A detailed, 360-degree view of a single candidate.
Left Panel: The candidate's resume/CV is displayed.
Center Panel: A timeline of all activities related to this candidate (emails, interview notes, feedback).
Right Panel: The candidate's contact information, current pipeline stage, and a star rating from the hiring team.
Action Buttons: Schedule Interview, Send Email, Reject Candidate, Move to Offer Stage.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Adding a Candidate (AI Feature): The user can upload a resume (PDF or Word doc). Aura Recruit uses an AI Resume Parser to automatically read the resume and fill in the candidate's name, email, phone, work experience, and skills, saving a huge amount of manual data entry.
Scheduling an Interview (Modal): Clicking "Schedule Interview" opens a modal that integrates with the hiring team's Aura Calendars. It allows the recruiter to see when everyone is free, select a time slot, and send a professional interview invitation to both the candidate and the interviewers.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Job" Flow: A manager needs to hire a new person. They go to Aura Recruit and click + New Job Opening. They fill out a form with the job title and description. This new job appears on the company's public Careers Site and is automatically posted to linked Job Boards.
The "Application" Flow (Automation): A candidate sees the job on LinkedIn and applies. Their application, including their resume, automatically appears as a new Candidate Card in the "New Applicant" stage of the hiring pipeline for that job. The AI Resume Parser runs automatically, and the recruiter is notified.
The "Hiring" Flow: The recruiter reviews the new candidate's profile. They like what they see, so they drag the card to the "Interview" stage. This triggers an automated email to the candidate asking them to schedule a time. After the interviews, the team leaves feedback on the candidate's profile. The team decides to hire the candidate, and the recruiter drags their card to the "Offer" stage. This opens a wizard to create and send a formal offer letter (using Aura Sign for e-signature).
The "Onboarding" Flow (Integration): The candidate accepts the offer. The recruiter drags their card to the final "Hired" stage. This is the magic step. This action automatically triggers the onboarding workflow in Aura People, creating an employee profile, sending them their welcome documents, and notifying the IT and payroll departments.
