3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Three-Panel View)
The main interface is a classic, three-panel email client.
Left Panel: The Internal Sidebar we just described.
Center Panel (The Message List):
A list of emails in the selected folder.
Toolbar at the top: Buttons for Archive, Delete, Mark as Spam, Move to Folder, Add Tag. A "More Actions" (...) menu includes Snooze, Create Task from Email.
Right Panel (The Reading Pane):
Displays the content of the selected email.
Header: Shows sender, recipient, and subject.
Body: The email content.
AURA Integration Panel: A special, powerful section below the header. It automatically detects if the sender is a Contact in Aura CRM and displays a mini-profile with links to their recent Deals and Tickets.
Action Buttons: Reply, Reply All, Forward. A "More Actions" (...) menu includes Create Event from Email, Share to Stream.
4. Data Entry & Modals
The Compose Window (Modal Pop-up): A rich text editor for writing emails.
AI Features: "Smart Compose" (suggests the rest of your sentence) and a "Tone Analyzer."
Special Buttons: Attach from Aura WorkDrive, Request Read Receipt, Send Later.
Creating a Task from an Email (Modal): Clicking this opens a small pop-up pre-filled with the email's subject as the task title, allowing the user to set a due date and add it to a project.
5. Bottom Bar
A thin status bar showing "Storage Used" and a quick link to the other productivity apps (Calendar, Tasks, Notes).
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Triage" Flow: A user starts their day. They open their Inbox. They quickly archive non-important emails. For an important email from a client, they Snooze it until the afternoon when they have time to reply. For an email that requires a follow-up action, they click the "More Actions" menu and select Create Task, instantly turning the email into a to-do item in Aura Projects.
The "Team Collaboration" Flow: A user receives a critical email from a major client with a complex question. Instead of forwarding it and starting a confusing chain, the user clicks Share to Stream and selects the "#Project-A-Team" stream. The whole team is instantly notified in Aura Cliq. They can then have a chat conversation about the email, right next to it. Once they decide on a response, one person writes a reply.
The "CRM-Integrated" Flow: An email arrives from an unknown person. The AURA Integration Panel on the right says, "This person is not in your CRM." It provides a + Add as Lead button. With one click, a new lead is created in Aura CRM, and the email is automatically logged as the first activity on that lead's timeline.
