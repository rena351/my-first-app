6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Quote-to-Cash" Flow: A user creates a new Estimate for a customer. The customer accepts it. The user converts the Estimate into an Invoice with one click. They email the Invoice to the customer. The customer clicks a "Pay Now" link in the email and pays with a credit card. The payment is automatically recorded in Payments Received, and the Invoice status changes to Paid.
The "Expense Management" Flow: A user takes a photo of a lunch receipt with their phone. The Aura Books mobile app uses OCR (Text Recognition) to automatically read the vendor, date, and amount. It creates a new Expense record. The user just has to select the correct category ("Meals & Entertainment") and save.
The "End of Month" Flow: An accountant logs in. They go to the Banking tab and reconcile all the transactions for the month. Then, they go to the Reports tab and run the "Profit and Loss" and "Balance Sheet" reports. They export these as PDFs to send to the business owner.
