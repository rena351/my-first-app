4. Data Entry & Modals
Quick Create Event (Pop-up): Clicking on an empty time slot opens a small pop-over. It has a single field for "Event Title, Time, and Location" that uses AI to parse the text (e.g., typing "Team Meeting at 3pm at Main Office" automatically fills in the details).
Full Event Editor (Full Page Form or Large Modal):
Opens when you click "More Options" on the quick create pop-up or Create in the sidebar.
Fields: Title, Date & Time, Attendees (integrates with Aura Contacts), Location, Video Conferencing (a button to add an Aura Meeting link), Description, Attachments (from Aura WorkDrive), and Reminders.

6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Team Meeting" Flow: A manager needs to schedule a meeting. They click Create. They add the five members of their team to the Attendees list. They click the "Find a Time" button. The AI shows them three time slots tomorrow when everyone is available. The manager picks one. They click the "Add Video Conferencing" button, which instantly generates and adds an Aura Meeting link. They click Save. The event is automatically added to everyone's calendar, and they all receive an email invitation.
The "Project Deadline" Flow (Integration): A project manager in Aura Projects sets a deadline for a major task. This deadline automatically appears as an "all-day event" in the Aura Calendar for everyone on that project, ensuring the whole team is aware of the timeline.
The "Customer Booking" Flow (Integration): A customer uses the public Aura Bookings page to schedule a demo. The appointment automatically appears on the salesperson's "Work Calendar" in Aura Calendar, preventing them from being double-booked.
