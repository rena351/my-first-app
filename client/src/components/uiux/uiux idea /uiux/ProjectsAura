4. Data Entry & Modals
Creating a Project (Wizard): A multi-step wizard that asks for the "Project Name," "Start/End Dates," and allows you to choose a Project Template (e.g., "Software Development," "Marketing Campaign") which automatically creates standard task lists and milestones.
Logging Time (Modal): A simple pop-up where a user can select a task, enter the hours worked, and add a note. Often includes a "Start/Stop Timer" button for real-time tracking.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Project Kickoff" Flow: A manager clicks New Project and chooses the "Marketing Campaign" Template. This automatically creates the project with standard Milestones like "Planning," "Execution," and "Launch," and populates it with common Task Lists and tasks. The manager then goes to the Team section and invites the members of the marketing team to the project.
The "Daily Standup" Flow: A developer starts their day. They open their Dashboard in Aura Projects and look at the "My Tasks" widget to see their priorities. They open the Kanban Board for their current project, drag a task from "To Do" to "In Progress," and start a Timer to track their work on that task.
The "Client Billing" Flow (Integration): At the end of the week, the project manager goes to the Timesheets section. They can see all the hours logged by the team for a specific client's project. They select all the unbilled hours and click a "Generate Invoice" button. This automatically sends the detailed time log data to Aura Books, which creates a professional invoice ready to be sent to the client.
