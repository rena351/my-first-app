6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Service Manager's Daily Huddle" Flow: A manager starts their day by opening the Aura Service Plus Dashboard. They instantly see that there's a spike in incoming tickets related to "Product X." They also see that the "First Response Time" SLA is dropping. They can immediately drill down to see which agents are overloaded and reassign some of the unassigned tickets to balance the workload.
The "Complex Issue" Flow (Integrated): A customer starts a Live Chat in Aura SalesIQ about a problem. The chat agent realizes they can't solve it. With one click, they "Escalate to a Ticket." This automatically creates a new Ticket in Aura Desk, with the full chat transcript attached. The Desk agent sees the ticket and realizes a technician needs to go on-site. They click "Create Work Order." This automatically creates a Work Order in Aura FSM, pre-filled with the customer's info and the problem description from the ticket.
The "Proactive Support" Flow: The service manager is looking at the Reports in Service Plus. They run a report combining data from Aura Desk and the Knowledge Base. They discover that 20% of all support tickets are about the same simple issue: "how to reset your password." They realize their "Password Reset" help article is confusing. They assign a task to a technical writer to improve the article. The next month, they see that tickets related to that issue have dropped by 90%.
