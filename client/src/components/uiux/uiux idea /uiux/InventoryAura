6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Online Order" Flow (Automation): A customer places an order on the Aura Commerce store. Aura Inventory automatically receives the order. The stock level for that item is immediately reduced in the "Committed Stock" count, preventing it from being oversold on another channel. The new order appears in the Sales Orders list, ready to be processed.
The "Warehouse Fulfillment" Flow: A warehouse worker logs in. They see a new Sales Order. They click Create Package. The system generates a "Pick List" showing them exactly where to find the item in the warehouse (Aisle 5, Bin 3). They pick the item, pack it in a box, and then click Create Shipment. The system, integrated with the shipping carrier, automatically generates and prints a shipping label.
The "Low Stock" Flow (Automation): An item's "Stock on Hand" drops below its pre-set "Reorder Point." Aura Inventory automatically adds the item to a draft Purchase Order for its primary vendor. At the end of the day, the purchasing manager reviews the draft PO, confirms the quantities, and sends it to the vendor with one click.
