The core of the app is the Invoice Editor.
Interface:
A clean, visual representation of a professional invoice.
Fields at the top to select a Customer (which auto-fills their details).
A table in the middle to add Items from your catalog or enter them manually.
The system automatically calculates subtotals, taxes, and the final total.

4. Data Entry & Modals
The Customer Portal: When a customer receives an invoice email, it contains a link to a secure web page. On this page, they can view the invoice, download a PDF, and most importantly, click a Pay Now button to pay instantly with a credit card (integrated with Aura Payments/Checkout).
Payment Reminders (Automated): In the settings, a user can set up automated reminder emails (e.g., "Send a reminder 3 days before the due date," "Send another reminder 7 days after the due date if still unpaid").

6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Freelancer" Flow: A user finishes a project. They open Aura Invoice, click + New Invoice, select their client, and add a line item for "Web Design Services" with the agreed-upon price. They click Send. The client receives the professional PDF invoice via email.
The "Payment" Flow: The client clicks the Pay Now button in the email. They are taken to the secure Customer Portal where they enter their credit card details. The payment is processed. The invoice status in Aura Invoice automatically changes from Sent to Paid, and the user receives a notification.
The "Follow-up" Flow (Automation): An invoice is 7 days overdue. The automated reminder system, which the user set up once, automatically sends a polite but firm follow-up email to the client without the user having to do anything.
