6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Event Creation" Flow: An event manager starts by clicking + New Event. They go through the wizard to set up the basics. Then, they use the event-specific sidebar to work through the checklist: they build the Website, add the Agenda, Invite Speakers, and set up Ticket Types. Finally, they publish the website and start promoting the event.
The "Attendee Registration" Flow: A potential attendee lands on the public event website. They review the agenda and speakers. They click "Register," choose their ticket type, fill out the registration form, and pay (if it's a paid event). They automatically receive a confirmation email and a calendar invite. Their name is automatically added to the Manage Attendees list inside Aura Backstage.
The "Virtual Event Day" Flow: The event manager opens the Broadcast Studio. They can see the live feed and the upcoming session. They bring a speaker "on stage" from the virtual green room. They start the broadcast. While the session is live, they use the Onstage tools to manage audience Q&A and polls. When the session is over, they end the broadcast and start the next one.
