The Reply button has a dropdown with options like Reply and Set as Resolved.

A panel showing all the metadata for the ticket.
Dropdowns: Status (Open, In Progress, Closed), Priority (High, Medium, Low), Assignee (which agent is working on it).

6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Ticket" Flow: A new email comes into support@aura.com. Aura Desk automatically creates a new ticket and places it in the Unassigned Tickets view. An automation rule might automatically assign it to a specific team based on keywords in the subject line.
The "Agent Workflow": An agent starts their day. They open the My Open Tickets view. They click on the oldest ticket. They read the customer's question. In the Right Panel, they see the customer's history from Aura CRM. The agent realizes this is a common question, so in the Center Panel, they use a Template to insert a pre-written answer. They add a personal touch, click Reply and Set as Resolved, and then move to the next ticket in their queue.
The "Escalation" Flow (Automation): A high-priority ticket has not been answered for 2 hours, which is a violation of its SLA (Service Level Agreement). Aura Desk automatically reassigns the ticket to a senior support manager and sends them a notification in Aura Cliq, ensuring the customer gets a response.
The "Self-Service" Flow: A customer has a simple question. Instead of emailing support, they go to the company's website and open the "Help Center" (powered by the Aura Desk Knowledge Base). They type their question into a search bar, find the relevant article, and solve their own problem without ever creating a ticket.
