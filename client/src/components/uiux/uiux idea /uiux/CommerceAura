6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Product" Flow: A store owner wants to add a new t-shirt. They go to Products -> New Product. They fill out the title, write a description, and upload photos. In the "Variants" section, they add options for "Size" (Small, Medium, Large) and "Color" (Red, Blue), and the system automatically creates all the combinations. They set the price and initial stock quantity for each variant and click Save. The new t-shirt is now live on their online store.
The "Order Fulfillment" Flow: A new order notification appears. The owner goes to the Orders page and clicks on the new order. They see the customer's details and the product ordered. They click Print Packing Slip. They physically pack the product in a box, then come back and click Create Shipping Label. They enter the package weight and dimensions, buy the postage, and print the label. Finally, they click Fulfill Order and enter the tracking number. The customer automatically receives an email saying, "Your order has shipped!" and the order status updates to "Shipped."
The "Abandoned Cart" Flow (Automation): A visitor adds a product to their cart but leaves the website without buying. Aura Commerce automatically detects this. After 3 hours, an automated email is sent to the visitor from the Abandoned Cart Recovery campaign, saying "Did you forget something?" and includes a picture of the item and a direct link to complete their checkout.
