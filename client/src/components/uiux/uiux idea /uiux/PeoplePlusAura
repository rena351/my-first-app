The "Manager's Daily Review" Flow: A manager starts their day by opening the Aura People Plus Dashboard. They look at the "Pending Approvals" widget and see they have two leave requests and one expense report to review. They approve them all directly from the dashboard in under a minute.
The "Hiring to Onboarding" Flow (Integrated): A hiring manager in Aura Recruit marks a candidate as "Hired." This action is the start of a massive, cross-app workflow managed by People Plus. It automatically:
Creates an employee profile in Aura People.
Provisions a new user account in Aura Directory.
Assigns the "New Hire Onboarding" course in Aura Learn.
Adds the new employee to the next pay run in Aura Payroll.
The "Employee Self-Service" Flow: A new employee wants to check how many vacation days they have left. They log into Aura People Plus. They see their leave balance directly on their dashboard widget. They click it and are taken directly to the Leave Tracker page within the full Aura People application to submit a request.
