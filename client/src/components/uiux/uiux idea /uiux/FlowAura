3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Flow Builder)
The core of the application is the visual Flow Builder.
Main Interface: A simple, linear, top-to-bottom canvas.
Trigger (The "When"): At the very top, a box where you configure the starting event. The user clicks it and a side panel opens.
Actions (The "Then"): Below the trigger, a series of boxes representing the steps in the workflow. The user clicks a + button to add a new action.
Side Panel (Configuration):
When the user clicks on the Trigger or any Action box, a right-side panel slides open.
For a Trigger: It asks you to Choose an App and then Choose a Trigger Event from a dropdown (e.g., App: "Aura CRM", Trigger Event: "New Lead Created").
For an Action: It asks you to Choose an App and Choose an Action (e.g., App: "Aura Cliq", Action: "Send Message to Channel"). It then shows fields that you can fill in.
The Magic - Data Mapping: When filling in the fields for an action, you can click a button to insert "pills" of data from the previous steps. For example, in the "Send Message to Channel" action, you can write: New lead created: [Lead First Name pill] [Lead Last Name pill] from [Lead Company pill]. This dynamically inserts the data from the CRM trigger into the chat message.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Connecting an App (Modal): Clicking "Add New Connection" opens a pop-up that guides the user through a secure OAuth process to grant Aura Flow permission to access their account in another app (like their Google or Twitter account).
Testing a Flow: The builder has a "Test" button. When clicked, it runs the flow once with sample data and shows the user the input and output of every single step, making it easy to find and fix problems.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Sales Alert" Flow: A salesperson wants to be instantly notified of new leads. They create a new flow.
Trigger: App = Aura CRM, Event = New Lead.
Action 1: App = Aura Cliq, Action = Send Message to User. They select themselves as the user and map the lead's name and company into the message.
They turn the flow on. Now, every time a new lead is created in the CRM, they get an instant chat message.
The "Social Media to Task" Flow: A social media manager wants to turn important tweets into tasks.
Trigger: App = Twitter, Event = New Tweet from Search (they search for mentions of their brand).
Logic: Add a Decision block. IF the Tweet's text contains "help" or "problem".
Action (if true): App = Aura Projects, Action = Create a Task. They map the Tweet's text into the task description and assign it to the support team.
Now, only tweets that seem like support requests are automatically turned into tasks for the team to handle.
The "Invoice to Spreadsheet" Flow: An accountant wants to keep a backup of all new invoices in a spreadsheet.
Trigger: App = Aura Books, Event = New Invoice.
Action: App = Aura Sheet (or Google Sheets), Action = Add a Row. They map the Invoice Number, Customer Name, Amount, and Due Date from the invoice trigger to the correct columns in their spreadsheet.
The entire process of logging invoices is now automated.
