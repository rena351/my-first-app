6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Broken Laptop" Flow (Incident Management): An employee's laptop breaks. They go to the self-service portal and submit a New Incident. The ticket is automatically assigned to the "Hardware Support" team. A technician picks up the ticket, sees the employee's assigned laptop in the Asset details, and finds a solution in the Knowledge Base. They reply to the user with instructions.
The "New Employee" Flow (Service Request Management): An HR manager goes to the Service Catalog and clicks "Onboard New Employee." This is a single service request that automatically creates and assigns a series of linked tasks to different teams:
A task for IT to "Prepare a Laptop."
A task for Facilities to "Set up a Desk."
A task for HR to "Conduct Orientation."
The "Recurring Server Patch" Flow (Change Management): The IT team needs to apply security patches to a server every month. They create a new Change request. They detail the plan and schedule it for the weekend. The change is automatically sent to the CAB for approval. Once approved, the change is added to the IT calendar, ensuring the work is done in a planned and controlled manner, minimizing risk.
