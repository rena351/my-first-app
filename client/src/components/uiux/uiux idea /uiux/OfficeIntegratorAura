6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "SaaS Integration" Flow: A developer for another company (e.g., a Legal Tech startup) wants to add contract editing to their app. They sign up for Aura Office Integrator. They go to the API Keys page and generate a new key with Read and Write permissions. They read the Documentation to understand the API. In their own application's code, they use the API to create a new document session. When their user clicks "Edit Contract," their application displays the fully-featured Aura Writer editor inside their own UI, using the branding they configured in the White-Labeling section.
The "Collaborative Session" Flow: Two users are in the Legal Tech app, looking at the same contract. The app's backend uses the Office Integrator API to place both users into the same collaborative session. They can now see each other's cursors and type in real-time, all within the embedded Aura Writer, without ever knowing they are using an AURA product.
The "Document Generation" Flow (Automation): An insurance company needs to generate 1,000 personalized policy documents. A developer writes a script that calls the Office Integrator API. The script uses a Template from the company's account, loops through a list of customers, merges each customer's data into the template, and uses the Download as PDF API endpoint to generate a final, non-editable PDF for each customer, which is then saved to Aura WorkDrive.
