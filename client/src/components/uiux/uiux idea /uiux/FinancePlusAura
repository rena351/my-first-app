6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "CFO's Morning Briefing" Flow: A business owner starts their day by opening the Aura Finance Plus Dashboard. In a single glance, they can see their current bank balance, their projected cash flow for the month, how much money is overdue from customers, and which bills they need to pay this week. They see that "Expenses" are higher than usual, click on the widget, and are taken directly to the relevant report in Aura Expense to investigate.
The "Purchase-to-Pay" Flow (Integrated): A manager approves a Purchase Order in Aura Inventory. When the goods arrive, the warehouse manager marks the PO as "Received." This automatically creates a Bill in Aura Books. The accountant can then see this bill in their "Bills to be Paid" list on the Finance Plus dashboard, and they can schedule the payment. The entire process is seamless and tracked from start to finish.
The "Profitability Analysis" Flow: A manager wants to know if their biggest project is actually profitable. They go to the Reports section in Aura Finance Plus. They run the "Profitability by Project" report. This report automatically:
Pulls all the Invoices for that project from Aura Books.
Pulls all the employee Timesheets (and thus salary costs) for that project from Aura People.
Pulls all the direct Expenses logged against that project from Aura Expense.
It then presents a single, simple report showing Total Revenue - Total Costs = Net Profit for that project.
