6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "On-Demand Support" Flow: A customer calls support with a problem. The support agent in Aura Desk says, "Let me take a look." The agent opens Aura Assist, clicks Start Session, and reads the 9-digit code to the customer. The customer enters the code, downloads the applet, and clicks "Allow." The agent can now see the customer's screen, diagnose the problem, and fix it directly. At the end of the session, a recording is automatically saved and a link to it is added to the ticket in Aura Desk.
The "Unattended Maintenance" Flow: It is midnight. A system administrator needs to install a critical security patch on all the company's servers. They log into Aura Assist, go to Unattended Access, and select the "Servers" group. They connect to each server, one by one, without needing anyone to be physically present. They run the updates, reboot the servers, and log off. The entire process is logged in the Reports section.
The "Integration with Desk" Flow: A support ticket comes into Aura Desk. The agent sees it's a complex technical issue. Directly inside the Aura Desk ticket, there is an "Initiate Remote Session" button. The agent clicks it. This automatically opens Aura Assist and generates a session link. The agent pastes this link into the ticket reply. The customer clicks the link, and the remote session starts, already linked to the correct support ticket.
