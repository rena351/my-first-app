3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface (The Note Cards)
The main interface is a visual grid of "Note Cards." Each card has a different color and a preview of its content.
Top Toolbar (above the grid):
View Switcher: Icons to toggle between Card View (the visual default) and List View (a more compact, simple list).
Sort Controls: A dropdown to sort notes by Date Modified, Date Created, or Title.
The Note Editor (when you click on a card):
A clean, distraction-free editor opens, focused on the content.
The type of editor changes based on the note type (a text editor, a checklist interface, an image viewer, an audio player, a drawing canvas).
Toolbar at the bottom of the editor:
Actions: Set Reminder, Share Note, Add to Favorites (Star), Info (shows created date, word count), Move to Notebook.
Color Palette: A row of colors to change the background color of the note card.
More Actions (...): Version History, Lock Note (with a passcode), Delete.
4. Data Entry & Modals
Creating a Note: The primary interaction. On mobile, the user opens the app and is immediately presented with buttons to start a new text, audio, or photo note, designed for capturing ideas instantly.
The Web Clipper: A browser extension that allows a user to "clip" an entire webpage or a simplified, text-only version of it, which is then saved as a new note card in their Notebook.
Setting a Reminder (Modal): Clicking the reminder icon opens a simple pop-up with a date and time picker.
5. Bottom Bar
On the main dashboard, the + button is often a large, floating action button at the bottom of the screen for quick access.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Quick Idea" Flow: A user is walking and has a great idea. They pull out their phone, open Aura Notebook, and tap the Audio Note button. They speak their idea. The app records the audio and, using AI, also provides an automatic text transcription of their words. The note is now searchable by text.
The "Meeting Notes" Flow: A user is in a meeting. They open a new Text Note. They type the meeting notes. Another team member takes a picture of the whiteboard with their phone and adds it to the same note as a Photo Card. The note now contains both the typed text and the image, all in one place.
The "Shopping List" Flow: A user creates a Checklist Card for their groceries. They add items like "Milk," "Eggs," "Bread." They share this note with their spouse. At the store, they both open the same note on their phones. As one person puts an item in the cart, they check it off the list, and the list updates in real-time on the other person's phone.
The "Research" Flow: A user is researching a topic online. They use the Web Clipper browser extension to save three important articles to their "Research" notebook. Later, they open Aura Notebook, go to that notebook, and use the search bar to find a specific keyword. The search results show that keyword not only in the text of the articles but also in a screenshot they had taken and saved as a photo note, thanks to the AI-powered OCR.
