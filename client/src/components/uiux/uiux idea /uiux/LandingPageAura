6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Ad Campaign" Flow: A user is running a Google Ad for a new ebook. They go to Aura LandingPage and click Create New Page. They choose an "Ebook Download" template. They use the builder to change the headline to match their ad copy and upload a picture of the ebook. They configure the form to send new leads to a specific list in Aura Campaigns. They click Publish and get a unique URL. They then use this URL as the destination for their Google Ad.
The "Optimization" Flow: The user sees that their landing page has a low conversion rate (only 2% of visitors are filling out the form). They decide to run an A/B test. They open the page in the builder and click the A/B Testing button. In the Variation, they change the headline from "Download Our Ebook" to "Get Your Free Marketing Guide." They run the test for a week. Aura LandingPage automatically directs 50% of traffic to each version. At the end of the week, it shows that the new headline increased the conversion rate to 5%. The user can then click a button to "Apply this variation" and make it permanent.
The "Dynamic Text" Flow (Advanced): A user is running ads with different keywords. They set up "Dynamic Text Replacement" on their landing page. Now, if a user clicks an ad for the keyword "small business accounting," the headline on the landing page automatically changes to "Accounting Software for Small Businesses." This personalization dramatically increases conversion rates.
