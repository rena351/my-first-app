3. Page-Level Toolbars & Main Interface
On the "Crashes" Page:
A list of crash groups, prioritized by the number of users affected.
Each item shows the error message, the file where it occurred, and the number of occurrences.
The "Crash Detail" View:
Clicking a crash group opens a detailed view.
Stack Trace: The most important part. A detailed, line-by-line code trace that shows the exact sequence of function calls that led to the crash.
Context: Information about the device, OS, and user activity at the time of the crash.
Action Toolbar: Buttons to Change Status (Open, In Progress, Fixed), Assign to Developer, and Link to Bug (integrates with Aura BugTracker).
The "Funnel Builder":
A simple, step-by-step interface where a user selects a sequence of Events to define their funnel (e.g., Step 1: "app_launched", Step 2: "viewed_product", Step 3: "added_to_cart", Step 4: "completed_purchase"). The tool then automatically generates the visualization.
4. Data Entry & Modals
This application is primarily for viewing data that is sent from your live application via the Apptics SDK.
Creating a Push Notification Campaign (Wizard): A multi-step wizard to define the Audience (user segment), write the Message, and Schedule the notification.

6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "Developer" Flow: A developer releases a new version of their mobile app. The next morning, they open Aura Apptics and go to the Crashes page. They see a new, critical crash affecting 5% of users on the latest version. They click on it to view the full Stack Trace, which points them to the exact line of code that is causing the problem. They link the crash to a new bug in Aura BugTracker and begin working on a fix.
The "Product Manager" Flow: A product manager wants to know if people are using the new "Advanced Search" feature. They go to the Events page and look at the count for the "advanced_search_used" event they asked the developers to add. They see that very few people are using it. They then create a Funnel to see where users are dropping off. They discover that most users are not even finding the button.
The "Marketing" Flow (Engagement): The product manager wants to encourage users to try the new feature. They go to Push Notifications. They create a new Audience segment: "Users who have been active in the last 30 days but have NOT used the Advanced Search feature." They write a push notification message: "Did you know? You can now use Advanced Search to find exactly what you're looking for!" and send it to that specific segment.
