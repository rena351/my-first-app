A view of the contract document itself, often using an embedded Aura Writer editor.

A tabbed interface with all the metadata and collaboration tools.
Tab: Details: Shows key information like "Counterparty," "Effective Date," "Renewal Date," and "Contract Value."
Tab: Approvals: Shows the approval workflow, indicating whose approval is pending.
Tab: Collaboration: A threaded view of all Comments and a Version History of the document.
Tab: Signatures: Shows the status of the e-signature process (integrates with Aura Sign).
4. Data Entry & Modals
Creating a New Contract (Wizard): A user clicks New Contract. A modal asks them to choose a Template. The system then generates a new draft, and the user fills in the variable fields (like the client's name and the dollar amount).
Starting an Approval Workflow (Action): When a user finishes drafting, they click a prominent "Submit for Approval" button. This automatically sends notifications to the first person in the pre-defined approval workflow.
5. Bottom Bar
Non-existent.
6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The "New Sales Contract" Flow: A salesperson in Aura CRM closes a deal. They click a "Generate Contract" button. This automatically opens Aura Contracts, selects the "Sales Agreement" Template, and pre-fills the client's information from CRM. The salesperson reviews the draft and clicks Submit for Approval. The contract is automatically sent to their manager.
The "Legal Review" Flow: The sales manager receives a notification and approves the contract. The workflow automatically sends it to the Legal Department queue. A lawyer opens the contract. They notice a risky clause, so they use the Clause Library to replace it with the company's standard, pre-approved version. They then approve the contract.
The "Execution" Flow: Once all internal approvals are complete, the system automatically sends the contract to the client for signature via the Aura Sign integration. After the client signs, the system automatically countersigns and distributes the final, executed copy to all parties. The contract Status updates to "Active."
The "Renewal" Flow (Automation): 90 days before the contract's expiration date, the system automatically creates a Task in Aura CRM and assigns it to the salesperson, reminding them to start the renewal conversation with the client.
