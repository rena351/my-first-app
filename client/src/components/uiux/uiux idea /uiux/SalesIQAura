6. Task Info & Key Workflows
The Engagement Flow: A user (sales/support agent) keeps the "Visitor Ring View" open on their screen. When they see a highly engaged visitor (someone in the inner rings), they can click on them and proactively start a chat by typing a message like, "Hello! I see you are looking at our pricing page. Can I help you with anything?"
The Chatbot-to-Human Handoff Flow: A new visitor is first greeted by the "Lead Qualification Bot." The bot asks a few questions ("Are you interested in sales or support?"). If the visitor's answers indicate they are a hot lead, the bot automatically transfers the chat to a live human agent, who sees the entire conversation history and can take over seamlessly.
The CRM Integration Flow: While chatting with a visitor, the agent sees their info on the right. If the visitor is not yet in the CRM, the agent can click a + Add to CRM button. This opens a small form, pre-filled with the visitor's name and email, and with one click, creates a new Lead record in Aura CRM.
